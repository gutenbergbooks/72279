INTRODUCTION.
</h2>


<p>
Three years have nearly elapsed since I had the pleasure
of presenting you with the third volume of my “Ornithological
Biography,” and about twelve since the first fasciculus of my
“Illustrations of the Birds of America” was submitted to your
inspection. This work, comprising four hundred and thirty-five
plates, and one thousand and sixty-five figures, was finished on
the 20th of June 1838, without the continuity of its execution
having been broken for a single day, and the numbers having
been delivered with exemplary regularity; for all which I am
indebted to my friend and Engraver, Mr <span class="smcap">Robert Havell</span>. Once
more surrounded by all the members of my dear family, enjoying
the countenance of numerous friends who have never
deserted me, and possessing a competent share of all that can
render life agreeable, I look up with gratitude to the Supreme
Being, and feel that I am happy.
</p>

<p>
The adventures and vicissitudes which have fallen to my
lot, instead of tending to diminish the fervid enthusiasm of my
nature, have imparted a toughness to my bodily constitution,
naturally strong, and to my mind, naturally buoyant, an
elasticity, such as to assure me that, though somewhat old,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vi' href='#Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
and considerably denuded in the frontal region, I could yet
perform on foot a journey of any length, were I sure that I
should thereby add materially to our knowledge of the ever-interesting
creatures which have for so long a time occupied
my thoughts by day, and filled my dreams with pleasant
images. Nay, Reader, had I a new lease of life presented to
me, I should chuse for it the very occupations in which I
have been engaged.
</p>

<p>
And, Reader, the life which I have led has been in some
respects a singular one. Think of a person intent on such
pursuits as mine have been, aroused at early dawn from his
rude couch on the alder-fringed brook of some northern valley,
or in the midst of some yet unexplored forest of the west,
or perhaps on the soft and warm sands of the Florida shores,
and listening to the pleasing melodies of songsters innumerable,
saluting the magnificent orb from whose radiant influence
the creatures of many worlds receive life and light.
Refreshed and reinvigorated by healthful rest, he starts upon
his feet, gathers up his store of curiosities, buckles on his
knapsack, shoulders his trusty firelock, says a kind word to
his faithful dog, and recommences his pursuit of zoological
knowledge. Now the morning is spent, and a squirrel or a
trout afford him a repast. Should the day be warm, he reposes
for a time under the shade of some tree. The woodland
choristers again burst forth into song, and he starts anew,
to wander wherever his fancy may direct him, or the objects
of his search may lead him in pursuit. When evening approaches
and the birds are seen betaking themselves to their
retreats, he looks for some place of safety, erects his shed of
green boughs, kindles his fire, prepares his meal, and as the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vii' href='#Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
Widgeon or Blue-winged Teal, or perhaps the breast of a
Turkey, or a steak of venison, sends its delicious perfumes
abroad, he enters into his parchment-bound journal the remarkable
incidents and facts that have occurred in the course
of the day. Darkness has now drawn her sable curtain over
the scene, his repast is finished, and kneeling on the earth he
raises his soul to Heaven, grateful for the protection that has
been granted to him and the sense of the Divine presence in
this solitary place. Then wishing a cordial good night to all
the dear friends at home, <span class="smcap">the American Woodsman</span> wraps
himself up in his blanket, and closing his eyes, soon falls into
that comfortable sleep which never fails him on such occasions.
</p>

<p>
Since I last parted from you, my exertions have been unremitted,
and my rambles extended as far as circumstances allowed,
for I have been ever anxious to render the fourth and
concluding volume of my Illustrations as worthy of your approbation
as I could. Whether I have added to our knowledge
of the birds which constantly reside within the limits of
the United States and their Territories, or periodically visit us
from the South, it is yours to say. That I have left undone much
that might have been accomplished by an abler student of Nature,
is doubtless quite true; but that any would have prosecuted
the study of our numerous feathered denizens with more
good will or more sincere desire to obtain facts and rectify errors,
would, I think, be difficult to prove. If my “Birds of
America,” and “Ornithological Biography,” are looked upon
by you as having contributed in some degree to the improvement
of our knowledge of these my favourite objects of observation,
and as likely to stimulate other and perhaps more successful 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_viii' href='#Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
students to perfect it. I shall rest satisfied with my
labours.
</p>

<p>
Having hitherto given you some account of the occurrences
that have taken place during the time intervening between
the appearance of one volume and that of another, I again resume
the subject, hoping that what I have now to say may
prove not less interesting to a friend like you. When I last
left Edinburgh, I proceeded to London, full of the desire to revisit
my native land before concluding my work. It was
my wish to cross the Continent of America, gaze on the majestic
wilds of the Rocky Mountains, wander along the green
valleys of the Oregon, and search the shores of the Pacific
Ocean and a portion of North California; but circumstances
denied me the pleasure anticipated. However, here we are
on the way to the metropolis of England; we have already
passed through Newcastle, York, Leeds, and Manchester, and
are just about to alight in the Main Street of Sheffield. The
gentleman who meets me at the coach door, is <span class="smcap">John Heppenstall</span>,
Esq., well known to me by correspondence, but not
personally until now. Arrived here according to appointment,
we shake hands, and in a few minutes are beneath his most
hospitable roof, and in the midst of his family and friends.
The expectations which we had formed, so far from being disappointed,
were more than gratified, for this sincere and honourable
man is distinguished, not less by liberality of sentiment
than by a generosity commensurate with the goodness
of his heart. In these respects every member of his family is
a counterpart of himself; and, such being our hosts, you may
judge how agreeable to us was our stay in Sheffield. It was
while enjoying the hospitality of this excellent friend, that we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_ix' href='#Page_ix'>ix</a></span>
became acquainted with <span class="smcap">Ebenezer Elliot</span>, Esq. and subsequently
with <span class="smcap">Jonathan Brammell</span>, Esq. from whom we have
since received many acts of kindness. Stopping afterwards
at Derby, we saw our relations there, and on arriving in London
were kindly welcomed by my brother-in-law, <span class="smcap">Alexander
Gordon</span>, Esq., and soon established ourselves in a house in
Wimpole Street.
</p>

<p>
I now again enjoyed the society of our numerous friends,
and had the pleasure of seeing my work proceed apace. One
day Mr <span class="smcap">Robert Havell</span> informed me, that a gentleman, a
Fellow of the Royal Society, residing not far from us, in
the same street, had subscribed for the Birds of America.
The gentleman called to see me; my wife and myself, were
introduced to his lady, and the several members of his amiable
family, and our intimacy and friendship have ever since
increased. This excellent friend of mine is a surgeon of the
highest merit. Long before I left England for America, he took
charge of my wife’s precarious health; and when we parted at
the coach that took my son, <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>, and myself,
to Portsmouth, he promised to watch over her. When I again
reached my house in Wimpole Street, after an absence of a
year, he was the first friend to greet me with a cordial welcome.
Were I to mention the many occasions on which he
has aided me by his advice and superior knowledge of the
world, you would be pleased to find so much disinterestedness
in human nature. His professional aid too, valuable as it has
proved to us, and productive of much inconvenience to him, has
been rendered without reward, for I could never succeed in
inducing him to consider us his patients, although for upwards
of two years he never passed a day without seeing my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_x' href='#Page_x'>x</a></span>
wife. But why should I say more? This fine specimen of
human nature, eminent for every virtue, this kind and generous
friend, is <span class="smcap">Benjamin Phillips</span>, Esq.
</p>

<p>
Having been long anxious to introduce into America several
species of European birds, which I thought might thrive
with us, I purchased about an hundred individuals of that
delightful songster, the Sky Lark, fifty Starlings, and several
Jays and Wood Pigeons, intending to set them loose in the
Western States. Putting them in ample cages, accompanied
with a store of food for the voyage, I had them sent on board
in the London Docks; but on our reaching Portsmouth by
land, we heard that the weather had been very bad in the
Channel, and that our birds had suffered severely. The news,
to my vexation, proved true; many of the birds had died;
and, although our passage to New York was pleasant as well
as speedy, very few were landed, so that my hopes were entirely
disappointed.
</p>

<p>
On the 1st of August 1836, we went on board the fine
American Packet Ship, the Gladiator, commanded by <span class="smcap">Thomas
Britton</span>, Esq. and proceeded on our voyage, which proved
agreeable. On arriving at New York, we soon reached the
house of my good friend and brother-in-law <span class="smcap">Nicholas Berthoud</span>,
Esq. Leaving my son there, I proceeded almost immediately
to Boston, where, under the roof of my generous friend
Dr <span class="smcap">George C. Shattuck</span>, I enjoyed life for a while. My friend
Dr <span class="smcap">George Parkman</span> was absent, and I missed him much.
Here, through the kindness of Dr <span class="smcap">Shattuck</span>, I procured two
subscribers, and formed acquaintance with <span class="smcap">Thomas M. Brewer</span>,
Esq., from whom I have received many valuable services, which
you will find mentioned in the proper places. Pushing on to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xi' href='#Page_xi'>xi</a></span>
Salem I formed some acquaintances there, and procured several
subscribers; then returned to Boston, and as fortune would
have it, heard of the arrival of <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, Esq., the
well-known zoologist, botanist, and mineralogist, who had
performed a journey over the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific
Ocean, accompanied by our mutual friend <span class="smcap">John Kirk Townsend</span>,
Esq., M. D. Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> generously gave me of his ornithological
treasures all that was new, and inscribed in my
journal the observations which he had made respecting the habits
and distribution of all the new and rare species which were
unknown to me. All this information you will find in the different
articles to which it refers, and you will allow that while
it proves his zeal for the furtherance of science, it manifests
the generosity of his noble nature.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend’s</span> collection was at Philadelphia; my anxiety
to examine his specimens was extreme; and I therefore, bidding
farewell to my Boston friends, hurried off to New York,
where, in a week, I added eighteen names to my list of subscribers,
in obtaining which I was materially aided by my
brother-in-law. Once more my son and I reached Philadelphia,
where at once we placed ourselves under the roof of my
ever staunch and true friend <span class="smcap">Richard Harlan</span>, Esq., M. D.,
with whom we remained several weeks. Soon after my arrival,
I called on my learned friend Dr <span class="smcap">Charles Pickering</span>,
formed the desired acquaintance of an enthusiastic young ornithologist,
<span class="smcap">James Trudeau</span>, Esq., and met my firm friend <span class="smcap">Edward
Harris</span>, Esq. Having obtained access to the collection
sent by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, I turned over and over the new and rare
species; but he was absent at Fort Vancouver, on the shores
of the Columbia River; <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> had not yet come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xii' href='#Page_xii'>xii</a></span>
from Boston, and loud murmurs were uttered by the <i>soi-disant</i>
friends of science, who objected to my seeing, much less
portraying and describing those valuable relics of birds, many
of which had not yet been introduced into our Fauna. The
traveller’s appetite is much increased by the knowledge of the
distance which he has to tramp before he can obtain a meal;
and with me the desire of obtaining the specimens in question
increased in proportion to the difficulties that presented
themselves. Having ascertained the names of the persons best
able or most willing to assist me on this occasion, and aided
by <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, who had now arrived, Drs <span class="smcap">Pickering</span>,
<span class="smcap">Harlan</span>, <span class="smcap">S. G. Morton</span>, Secretary to the Academy of Natural
Sciences, <span class="smcap">M’Murtrie</span>, <span class="smcap">Trudeau</span>, and above all my friend
<span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, who offered to pay for them with the view
of presenting them to me, I at length succeeded. It was
agreed that I might <i>purchase duplicates, provided</i> the specific
names agreed upon by Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> and myself were published
in Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend’s</span> name. This latter part of the affair was
perfectly congenial to my feelings, as I have seldom cared
much about priority in the naming of species. I therefore
paid for the skins which I received, and have now published
such as proved to be new, according to my promise. But, let
me assure you, Reader, that seldom, if ever in my life, have I
felt more disgusted with the conduct of any opponents of
mine, than I was with the unfriendly boasters of their zeal
for the advancement of ornithological science, who at the time
existed in the fair city of Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
From Philadelphia I bent my course toward Baltimore,
where I spent a few days. Before leaving the former city,
my good friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span> had promised to join us at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xiii' href='#Page_xiii'>xiii</a></span>
Charleston, for the purpose of accompanying us along the
western coast of the Floridas, and the Gulf of Mexico, at
least as far as Galveston Island in Texas. On reaching the
city of Washington, I presented myself to the Honourable
<span class="smcap">Levi Woodbury</span>, Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States, a gentleman of learning, long friendly towards me,
who at once assured me that he would, if possible, grant me
one of our Revenue Cutters, for my intended voyage. The
war, which was at that time raging between the Seminole
Indians and the citizens of Florida tended strongly to frustrate
my wishes, as every disposable vessel of the class under
the Secretary of the Treasury was engaged on the coast of the
Peninsula. I called on President <span class="smcap">Andrew Jackson</span>, from
whom, since 1819, I have received peculiar facilities, and
who assured me of his wish to grant my request. My son and
I dined with him on that day <i>sans façon</i>, both of us in the undress
best suited to practical students of nature. And here
I may inform you, that I have seldom eaten of a better Wild
Turkey than the one which graced his table, and which had
been procured not many miles distant from our centre of political
intercourse. I also had the pleasure of seeing my excellent
friend, Colonel <span class="smcap">J. J. Abert</span>, of the U. S. Topographical
Department, the Honourable <span class="smcap">J. R. Poinsett</span>, and the Secretary
of the Navy, to whom I then recommended several
American naturalists as worthy of being engaged on any naval
expedition of discovery.
</p>

<p>
We now proceeded towards Charleston in South Carolina,
travelling the latter part of the way on one of the most extraordinary
rail-roads in the world, and reached in safety the
house of my worthy friend the Reverend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, D.D.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xiv' href='#Page_xiv'>xiv</a></span>
It was indeed a happy meeting! Here I opened the box containing
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend’s</span> precious series of birds, and while
waiting the arrival of Mr <span class="smcap">Harris</span>, drew upwards of seventy
figures of the species which I had procured at Philadelphia,
assisted in the finishing of the plants, branches of trees, and
flowers, which accompany these figures, by my friend’s sister-in-law
Miss <span class="smcap">M. Martin</span>, to whom I now again offer my most
sincere thanks. While here I received the agreeable intelligence
of my having been elected a Member of the Ornithological
Society of London.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span> joined me, but the Revenue Cutter had
not made its appearance; and time becoming precious, on account
of the approach of spring, we bid adieu to all at Charleston,
and pushed for New Orleans, where, I was informed by
Government letters, I should meet with a vessel. On reaching
Augusta in Georgia, I called on Dr <span class="smcap">Wray</span>, who promised
to forward to me a number of plants for my noble
friend Lord <span class="smcap">Ravensworth</span>, who has received them in good
order.  After several days of severe travelling, we arrived
at Montgomery in Alabama, and meeting there with
a steam-boat bound to Mobile, secured our passage. Next
day we arrived there, and spent two days in examining the
neighbourhood; after which we proceeded to Pensacola, where
I felt proud to find a harbour commodious enough to contain
a fleet sufficient to repel the attacks of any naval force brought
against the United States. Here I made the long-sought-for
acquaintance of Mr <span class="smcap">Innerarity</span>, to whom I had letters from
my friend <span class="smcap">Alexander Gordon</span>, Esq., and who introduced us
to all who were likely to forward our views. The next morning
he accompanied us on board the United States’ frigate, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xv' href='#Page_xv'>xv</a></span>
Constellation, and presented us to Commodore <span class="smcap">Dallas</span>, to
whom I had letters of introduction from our government. This
polite and gallant officer received us all with great kindness,
and, after reading my letters, assured me that as soon as a
cutter could be spared, it should be at my service, and that
the information would be transmitted to me through the medium
of the Collector of Customs at Mobile or New Orleans.
After searching the country around Pensacola, we returned to
Mobile, and proceeded to New Orleans in a steamer, by way
of the great lakes.
</p>

<p>
Having previously received the most pressing invitation
from my friend <span class="smcap">James Grimshaw</span>, Esq., my son and I went
at once to his house, where we were treated with all the kindness
to be expected from a true English gentleman. I had
the pleasure of renewing my acquaintance with Ex-Governor
<span class="smcap">Roman</span>, and several members of his most amiable family,
among whom was Mr <span class="smcap">Zaringue</span>. From that gentleman
I received much valuable information respecting some of
our birds, as well as from my long-known acquaintance, the
great sportsman Mr <span class="smcap">Louis Adam</span>. Here also I for the last
time met with good M. <span class="smcap">Le Sueur</span>, well known to the world of
science as a zoologist of great merit, and with whom I first
became acquainted at Philadelphia in 1824. He, alas! is now
no more.
</p>

<p>
Having called on Mr <span class="smcap">Breedlove</span>, Collector of Customs for
New Orleans, and presented to him my letters from the Honourable
<span class="smcap">Levi Woodbury</span>, he at once assured me that the Revenue
Cutter the Campbell, would be at my disposal in a very few
days. But the service, or other circumstances, did not allow
the arrival of that vessel at New Orleans until late in March,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xvi' href='#Page_xvi'>xvi</a></span>
and at a time when, apprehensive that our intended voyage
might be frustrated, we were all “crest-fallen.” Time, however,
passed on, and one morning I was gladdened by being called
upon by the Commander of the Campbell, and still more upon
recognising in him the Lieutenant and Pilot of the Marion,
or Lady of the Green Mantle, so frequently mentioned in the
former volumes of these Ornithological Biographs. I knew
that <span class="smcap">Napoleon Coste</span> was a true sea-fowl. He assured me of
the excellence of his vessel, and gay and happy were we all
when we removed on board the tight little sea-boat, of scarcely
more than sixty tons burden. Proceeding down the Mississippi,
we sailed through its south-west Pass, where we were
joined by a vessel of eight tons, as a tender for our excursions
along the shores. It was commanded by Captain <span class="smcap">William
Taylor</span>, now, I believe, a Commodore in the Texian service,
a gentleman who has seen much of the world, an excellent
companion, and a good hunter and fisher.
</p>

<p>
Of our various excursions, whether by water or by land,
between the mouths of the Mississippi and the point at which
we returned, a detailed account would prove tedious and fatiguing;
for what interest can there be in the relation of our
wading through mud for whole days, exposed to the scorching
heat, and continually annoyed by myriads of insects? We
reached the Bay of Galveston on the 24th of April 1837, and
ransacked not only the island of that name, but all those in that
celebrated inlet of the Mexican Gulf, which we thought worthy
of our attention. It was a curious circumstance to me, that,
being on board of the first American armed vessel in the
United States’ Service that had entered the Bay, the fort of
Galveston returned the salute of twenty-six fires from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xvii' href='#Page_xvii'>xvii</a></span>
great gun of the Campbell; and almost equally so when I received
a visit from the Secretary of the Navy of the infant
Republic of Texas, with a written invitation to proceed to the
seat of Government, the newly founded city of Houston, distant
from our anchorage about eighty miles. Toward this
place the Campbell proceeded about twenty miles, when,
meeting with a bar, on which there is not more than about
four feet of water at full tide, she again came to anchor.
At this place, which is called Red-Fish Bar, on the 9th of May,
my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">Coste</span>, and five sailors
took the gig, while the Crusader, our tender, took the Secretary
of the Texian Navy, <span class="smcap">M. Fisher</span>, Esq., a Mr <span class="smcap">Ward</span>, my
son, and myself. We crossed a large but shallow bay with a
fair wind, and proceeding rapidly, passed the lately founded
town of New Washington, and soon afterwards several plantations,
the sight of all which afforded us much pleasure, as
contrasted with the low salt-marshes and flat lands along the
shores of the Mexican Bay, among which we had so long
wandered. About noon we entered Buffalo Bayou, near the
mouth of the San Jacinto River, almost opposite the celebrated
battle-ground. Ducks of various species, Ibises, Wild
Turkeys, and many other birds, were seen in great numbers,
and we proceeded smoothly over the then turbid waters of
the Bayou, until we reached a comfortable house, where we
spent the night, after previously examining several miles of
the country around.
</p>

<p>
The Secretary of the Texian Navy being anxious to reach
the seat of his government, we started in the gig of the Campbell,
although the rain, which had commenced in the night,
was falling in torrents, and the waters of the Bayou, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xviii' href='#Page_xviii'>xviii</a></span>
the day before were still, now rushed at a rapid rate toward
the Gulf. About two o’clock in the afternoon, we reached
Houston, completely drenched, and were soon afterwards introduced
to the President General <span class="smcap">Houston</span>, who received us
kindly, and offered us horses and men to assist us in our researches.
The town was crowded with hundreds of Indians,
only a few of whom were sober. Although here and there
groups of great interest to the painter might be seen, their
howlings and gesticulations were by no means pleasing. The
beautiful level plain on the margin of which Houston is situated,
was covered with water ankle deep. Having seen all
that was thought interesting, and offered the President as well
as all the officers of his Staff my best thanks, we returned to
our yawl, and floating on the accumulated waters, flew as it
were down the stream. Several days were afterwards spent
in rambling as much as possible over the country, and among
other places, we visited the battle-ground of San Jacinto, where
we saw scattered the remains of numerous individuals destroyed
in that bloody fray.
</p>

<p>
On our way towards “Red-Fish Bar,” we stopped two days
at the hospitable mansion of Colonel <span class="smcap">James Morgan</span>, who received
us in the most friendly manner. This spot, possessing
a fine extent of woodland, surrounded by vast prairies, ornamented
with numerous detached groves, reminded us of some
of the beautiful parks of England. There, among other rarities,
we procured a fine specimen of the climbing Rattle-snake
with <i>recurved</i> fangs, which, along with several others of the
same kind, is now in my possession.
</p>

<p>
On the 18th of May, we bade adieu to the Texas, amid the
salutes of the several armed Texian vessels at Galveston, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xix' href='#Page_xix'>xix</a></span>
were soon on the broad waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We
had as passenger Mr <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>, the British Consul at Tampico;
and after a pleasant voyage, anchored on the 24th within
the south-west Pass of the Mississippi. After visiting Captain
<span class="smcap">Taylor</span> and his family at the Balize, we were towed by
a steamer to New Orleans, where we arrived on the 27th.
Here I had the gratification of meeting with my youngest
brother-in-law, <span class="smcap">William G. Bakewell</span>, Esq. of Louisville, Kentucky,
as well as with his amiable wife, neither of whom I
had seen for several years.
</p>

<p>
The commercial revolution which had taken place during
our absence, prompted us to proceed at once to the eastward,
and bidding farewell to our friends, I and my son set out
for Charleston by way of Mobile, whence we crossed the
country in a cart with the United States’ mail-bags, whereon,
in lieu of downy beds and pillows, our bones rested in
cramped positions during the night, whilst by day we had
ample opportunities of walking over miserable roads, through
an almost uncultivated country, and with very indifferent fare.
On reaching Montgomery, however, we met with a good coach,
and moved more rapidly toward our destination.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span> had parted from us, at New
Orleans, and gone up the Mississippi to secure for me a collection
of preserved Reptiles and other objects; but, after a
more pleasant journey than ours, by way of Mobile, Pensacola,
and the level country between the latter and Augusta in
Georgia, joined us again at the house of our friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>,
where we arrived on the 5th of June. And here, good-natured
Reader, let me say to you, that the friendship which
had so long subsisted between that reverend gentleman and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xx' href='#Page_xx'>xx</a></span>
myself, became, still more cemented by the marriage of his
eldest daughter to my youngest son.
</p>

<p>
In the course of our long journeys through woods and over
plains, and of our sinuous sailings along the many bays,
creeks or bayous, which we visited on this expedition, notwithstanding
all our exertions and constant anxiety, we did
not discover a single bird not previously known. However,
the enterprise proved exceedingly interesting to my companions
and myself, and I trust its results will be found to
possess some value in your eyes also, for, as you will perceive,
it has enabled me to speak with more confidence on the migratory
movements of a good number of species which visit
us from southern climes during the breeding season. It also
enables me to define more accurately than I could otherwise
have done, the geographical distribution of most of those
which at various times make their appearance in the different
sections of the United States, and other portions of North
America.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Charleston, we reached Norfolk by a steamer, after
a short passage of thirty-eight hours, and proceeded at
once to Washington, where I presented myself to the President
of the United States, <span class="smcap">Martin van Buren</span>, to whom I
had letters from my amiable and celebrated friend, <span class="smcap">Washington
Irving</span>, Esq., and offered my best thanks to the heads
of the several departments, and my various friends. We then
passed rapidly through Baltimore and Philadelphia, my wish
being to reach New York as soon as possible. There I remained
a fortnight, while my son and daughter-in-law visited
the Falls of Niagara. They having returned, we embarked,
on the 16th of July 1837, on board the American packet-ship,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xxi' href='#Page_xxi'>xxi</a></span>
the England, commanded by <span class="smcap">Robert Waite</span>, Esq., for Liverpool,
where, seventeen days after, we were safely landed.
Here we quickly paid our respects to the <span class="smcap">Rathbones</span>, the
<span class="smcap">Chorleys</span>, and other friends, to whom bidding adieu at the
same time, we proceeded to join my family in London, where,
on the 7th of August, we once more met all together.
</p>

<p>
I found the publication of the “Birds of America” in a satisfactory
state of progression, but received the disagreeable
intelligence that a great number of my British patrons had
discontinued their subscriptions, and that most of those who
still received the numbers as they came out, were desirous of
seeing the work finished in Eighty Numbers, as I had at first
anticipated. On this account, I found myself obliged to introduce,
and in some instances to crowd, a number of species
into one and the same plate, in order to try to meet the wishes
of those who had by their subscriptions in some measure assisted
me in the publication of that work. This, however, I
did in such a manner as seemed best to accord with the affinities
of the species. But, Reader, Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> meantime
returned to Philadelphia, after an absence of about four years,
and with a second collection, containing several rare and new
birds, which, after meeting with the same difficulties as on the
former occasion, in consequence of the opposition of various enlightened
persons at Philadelphia, although Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> was
extremely desirous that every thing new or rare belonging to
our Fauna should be given to me, I received only a few weeks
before closing the engraving of my plates. A few others did
not reach me until several days after. What was I to do?
Why, Reader, to publish them to be sure; for this I should
have done, to the best of my power, even if every subscriber in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xxii' href='#Page_xxii'>xxii</a></span>
Europe had refused to take them. What! said I, shall the
last volume of the “Birds of America” be now closed, at a
time when new species are in my hands? No! And in spite
of threats from this quarter and that, that such and such persons
would discontinue their subscriptions (which indeed they
have done, and refused to take the few numbers that would
have rendered their copies complete), my wish to do all that
was in my power has been accomplished:—All Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>’s
species, as well as some received through different channels,
have been published. To that enthusiastic naturalist and excellent
friend I am also deeply indebted for the valuable notes
which he has forwarded to me through my friend <span class="smcap">Edward
Harris</span>.
</p>

<p>
I had the gratification of receiving at London a diploma
from the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec; and
since then have been favoured with a list of the birds which
have been observed in the environs of that city, by <span class="smcap">William
Sheppard</span>, Esq., his lady, and son, for which I offer them my
most sincere thanks. I am also much indebted to the members
of the Council of the Zoological Society of London, who
have never ceased to furnish me with whatever American
specimens their valuable museum contains, allowing me to
take them to my house. I am farther indebted to my excellent
and generous friend Professor <span class="smcap">J. T. Henslow</span> of Cambridge
for the continuance of his most kind services to me. Nor
must I here omit mentioning the efficient aid I have received
from <span class="smcap">Thomas Durham Weir</span>, Esq. of Boghead, in the county
of Linlithgow, and Mr <span class="smcap">Macduff Carfrae</span>, Preserver of Animals
in Edinburgh, who have kindly procured for me many specimens 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xxiii' href='#Page_xxiii'>xxiii</a></span>
of British birds for comparison with such of our American
species as seemed to be identical.
</p>

<p>
For several years past I have felt a great desire to place
before the world an account of the digestive organs of our
various birds. With this view I have, at a great expense, obtained
specimens preserved entire in spirits. In collecting
them I have received the most effectual aid from several of my
American friends, residing in different parts of the country;
and in particular from the Rev. Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> of Charleston in
South Carolina, Colonel <span class="smcap">Theodore Anderson</span> of Baltimore, Dr
<span class="smcap">Richard Harlan</span> of Philadelphia, Dr <span class="smcap">Thomas M. Brewer</span> of
Boston in Massachusetts, <span class="smcap">Thomas M’Culloch</span>, Esq. of Pictou in
Nova Scotia; <span class="smcap">Alexander Gordon</span>, Esq. of London, who wrote
to Havannah for Flamingoes; <span class="smcap">Jean Chartrand</span>, Esq. who
sent me a pair of these birds from Matanzas in Cuba; and from
Captain <span class="smcap">Napoleon Coste</span> of the United States’ Revenue Service.
Besides the valuable contributions of these friends, to whom my
warmest thanks are due, a vast number of specimens were procured
by the members of my several parties, in Labrador, in
Texas, and in various parts of the United States, as well as
many purchased from Mr <span class="smcap">Ward</span> of New York. An account
of the digestive organs and trachea of these, generally concise,
but occasionally of considerable length, you will find under
the articles to which they refer, in the present volume. These
anatomical descriptions, as well as the sketches by which they
are sometimes illustrated, have been executed by my learned
friend <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span>, who in the most agreeable
manner consented to undertake the labour, by no means small,
of such a task, and to whom those who are interested in the
progress of Ornithological science, as well as myself, must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xxiv' href='#Page_xxiv'>xxiv</a></span>
therefore feel indebted. These details I had resolved to present
to you, because I have thought that no perfect knowledge
of the affinities of species can be obtained until their internal
organization is known. I believe the time to be fast approaching
when much of the results obtained from the inspection of
the exterior alone will be laid aside; when museums filled with
stuffed skins will be considered insufficient to afford a knowledge
of birds; and when the student will go forth not only to
observe the habits and haunts of animals, but to procure specimens
of them to be carefully dissected.
</p>

<p class="p2">
When I commenced the present volume, I expected that it
should contain descriptions of all the species represented in
the fourth volume of my Illustrations; but, on proceeding, I
found that, even without Episodes, which I have been obliged
to exclude, in order to make room for anatomical notices, of
more interest to the scientific reader, I could not include more
than the usual number of one hundred species. In the fifth
and concluding volume, the printing of which has already begun,
you will find Descriptions of upwards of a hundred species,
many of which are new to science, together with Lists
illustrative of the geographical distribution of birds, an Appendix
containing additions and corrections, and, finally, a
Synopsis of the Birds of North America, methodically arranged,
with generic and specific characters.

<h2>
CANVASS-BACK DUCK.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula valisneriana</i>, Stephens</span>.

<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCI.  Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The range of the celebrated Duck with the history of which I commence
the fourth volume of my Biographs, may be considered as limited
on the one hand by the mouths of the Mississippi, and on the other by
the Hudson or North River. Beyond the latter it is rarely seen at any
season on our eastern coasts; and this circumstance, conjoined with its
being now and then observed on the upper waters of our Western Districts,
and its breeding in great numbers on the borders of Bear River,
which flows into the salt lake of Timpanajoz in upper California, as
well as in the marshes and along the banks of streams in many parts of
the Rocky Mountains, induces me to believe that the individuals of this
species, instead of proceeding along the shores, pass overland towards
their breeding grounds, however far northward they may be situated.
According to <span class="smcap">Dr Richardson</span>, it breeds in all parts of the Fur-Countries,
from the 50th parallel to their most northern limits.
</p>

<p>
While in our Atlantic Districts, it is found in much greater numbers
on the Chesapeake and the streams that flow into it, than any
where else. Indeed it is not more than twenty years since its regular
appearance and sojourn on the waters of the Southern States has been
observed or at least acknowledged. Although at New Orleans, where
it goes by the name of <i>Canard Cheval</i>, it has been known to the oldest
duck-shooters now alive, from their earliest recollection, it is not more
than about fifteen years since it began to rise, from a very low price to
two dollars the pair, at which it sold during my visit in March 1837.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This enhancement of its value I look upon as having arisen from
the preference given to it by the epicures of our Middle Districts, who
have strangely lauded it as superior to every other duck in the world.
This alleged pre-eminence has indeed become so deeply impressed on
the minds of many of our Southerns, that they have on various occasions
procured the transportation of numbers of Canvass-backs from
Baltimore to Charleston in South Carolina, and even to Savannah in
Georgia, although this species is by no means uncommon within a few
miles of the latter city, as well as on the Great Santee River. I well
remember that on my pointing out to a friend, now alas dead, several
dozens of these birds in the market of Savannah, he would scarcely believe
that I was not mistaken, and assured me that they were looked upon
as being poor, dry, and very fishy, in short not half so good as Mallards,
or Blue-winged Teals. With this I cordially agreed, for there, at that
season, they are not better than represented.
</p>

<p>
I found this species in considerable numbers on and about the numerous
inlets and rivers of East Florida; but did not see a single individual
on the Gulf of St Lawrence, along the coast of Labrador, or on
that of Newfoundland.
</p>

<p>
It arrives in the neighbourhood of New Orleans from the 20th of
October to the end of December, coming in flocks of eight or twelve,
probably the members of a single family, and, unlike many other species,
keeping in small groups during winter. At the approach of spring
however they flock together, and about the first of April depart in large
bodies. During their stay, they are wont to alight on wet prairies
and muddy ponds in all open places, feeding on the seeds of various
plants, of which may be particularized the wild oat and the water lily.
</p>

<p>
According to <span class="smcap">Alexander Wilson</span>, who first described this species,
their arrival in autumn in the Middle Districts takes place about the
15th of October; but more recent writers say, that “unless the
weather to the north has been severe, the Canvass-back rarely appears
till the middle of November.” With this I fully agree, being convinced
that their journeys to and from their breeding places are performed
across the country. Were this perfectly ascertained, it would
prove that this species, unlike most other ducks, instead of removing
farther southward in autumn and winter, takes what may be called
a lateral march toward our Eastern Districts, in which it remains
until the weather has become too cold for its constitution, when it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
forced a second time to migrate, and betake itself to warmer parts of
the country, where it continues during the rest of the winter.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species, although resembling that of our larger
sea-ducks in having the appearance of being rather laboured, is strong,
rapid, at times very elevated, and well sustained. It swims deeply, especially
when under apprehension of danger, and this probably the
better to enable it to escape by diving, at which it is almost as expert
as our sea or diving ducks. But although its speed on the water
is considerable, it moves rather heavily on land. Its food varies, according
to the season and locality. The plant named <i>Valisneria</i>, on
which it is said to feed when on the head waters of the Chesapeake,
is not found equally abundant in other parts, and even there is at times
so reduced in quantity, that this duck and several other species which
are equally fond of it, are obliged to have recourse to fishes, tadpoles,
water-lizards, leeches, snails, and molluscs, as well as such seeds as
they can meet with; all which have been in greater or less quantity
found in their stomach.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is known of its manners during the breeding season; and
we are equally ignorant of the changes of plumage which, like other
species, it may undergo at that period.
</p>

<p>
As I have not had very good opportunities of making myself acquainted
with the modes in which the Canvass-backs are obtained for
the markets, I here present an account of duck-shooting on the waters
of the Chesapeake, published some years ago in the “Cabinet of Natural
History,” and of which a copy has been transmitted to me by its
author, Dr <span class="smcap">J. J. Sharpless</span>, of Philadelphia, to whom, for this and
other marks of attention, I offer my best thanks.
</p>

<p>
“The Chesapeake Bay, with its tributary streams, has, from its
discovery, been known as the greatest resort of water-fowl in the
United States. This has depended on the profusion of their food,
which is accessible on the immense flats or shoals that are found near
the mouth of the Susquehanna, along the entire length of North-East
and Elk Rivers, and on the shores of the bay and connecting streams,
as far south as York and James Rivers.
</p>

<p>
“The quantity of fowl of late years has been decidedly less than
in times gone by; and I have met with persons who have assured me
that the number has decreased one-half in the last fifteen years. This
change has arisen, most probably, from the vast increase in their destruction, 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
from the greater number of persons who now make a business
or pleasure of this sport, as well as the constant disturbance they
meet with on many of their feeding grounds, which induces them to
distribute themselves more widely, and forsake their usual haunts.
</p>

<p>
“As early as the first and second weeks in October, the smaller
ducks, as the Buffel-head, <i>Anas Albeola</i>; South-southerly, <i>A. glacialis</i>;
and the Ruddy or Heavy-tailed Duck, <i>A. rubidus</i>, begin to shew themselves
in the upper part of the bay; and by the last of the month, the
Black-head, <i>A. Marila</i>; Widgeon or Bald-pate, <i>A. Americana</i>; Red-head,
<i>A. Ferina</i>; and the Goose, <i>A. Canadensis</i>, appear, and rapidly
distribute themselves down the bay. The Canvass-back, <i>A. Valisneria</i>,
and the Swan, <i>Cygnus Americanus</i>, rarely, unless the weather to the
north has been severe, appear in quantities till the middle of November.
All these fowl, when first arrived, are thin and tasteless, from
their privation during their migration, and perhaps preparatory arrangements,
and require some days at least of undisturbed repose, to
give them that peculiar flavour for which some of them are so celebrated.
During the low tides succeeding their arrival, the birds sit on
the flats far from the shores, and rarely rise to the wing unless disturbed;
but when the spring-tides render the water too deep for feeding,
they commence their career, and pass down the bay in the morning,
and return in the evening. Most of these fowl feed on the same
grass, which grows abundantly on the shallows in the bay and adjacent
waters, and has been called duck-grass, <i>Valisneria Americana</i>. It grows
from six to eighteen inches in length, and is readily pulled up by the
root. Persons who have closely observed these ducks while feeding,
say that the Canvass-back and Black-head dive and pull the grass from
the ground, and feed on the roots, and that the Red-head and Bald-pate
then consume the leaves. Indeed, although the Bald-pate is a
much smaller bird than the Canvass-back, it has been seen to rob the
latter, immediately on its return from under the water, of all its spoil.
</p>

<p>
“All these larger ducks are found together when feeding, but separate
when on the wing. That they feed on the same grass, is evident
from the similarity of flavour; and those most accustomed to the
article have a difficulty in deciding on the kind of duck from the taste.
Indeed, the Bald-pate is generally preferred by residents.
</p>

<p>
“By the middle of December, particularly if the weather has been
a little severe, the fowl of every kind have become so fat, that I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
seen Canvass-backs burst open in the breast in falling on the water;
and spending less time in feeding, they pass up and down the bay from
river to river, in their morning and evening flights, giving, at certain
localities, great opportunities for destruction. They pursue, even in
their short passages, very much the order of their migratory movements,
flying in a line, or baseless triangle; and when the wind blows on the
<i>points</i> which may lie on their course, the sportsman has great chances of
success. These points or courses of the ducks are materially affected
by the winds, for they avoid, if possible, an approach to the shore; but
when a strong breeze sets them on these projections of the land, they
are compelled to pass within shot, and often over the land itself.
</p>

<p>
“In the Susquehanna and Elk rivers, there are few of these points for
shooting, and there success depends on approaching them while on their
feeding grounds. After leaving the eastern point at the mouth of the
Susquehanna and Turkey Point, the western side of the Elk River,
which are both moderately good for flying shooting, the first place of
much celebrity is the <i>Narrows</i>, between Spesutie Island and the western
shore. These narrows are about three miles in length, and from three
to five hundred yards in breadth. By the middle of November, the
Canvass-backs in particular, begin to feed in this passage, and the entrance
and outlet, as well as many intermediate spots, become very
successful stations. A few miles further down the western shore is
Taylor’s Island, which is situated at the mouth of the Rumney, and
Abbey Island at the mouth of Bush River, which are both celebrated
for ducks, as well as swans and geese. These are the most northerly
points where large fowl are met with, and projecting out between
deep coves, where immense numbers of these birds feed, they possess
great advantages. The south point of Bush River, or Legoe’s Point,
and Robbin’s and Rickett’s Points near Gunpowder River, are fruitful
localities. Immediately at the mouth of this river is situated Carroll’s
Island, which has long been known as a great shooting ground, and is
in the rentage of a company at a high rate. Maxwell’s Point, as well
as some others up this and other rivers, and even further down the bay,
are good places, but less celebrated than those I have mentioned.
Most of these points are let out as shooting grounds to companies and
individuals, and they are esteemed so valuable that intruders are severely
treated.
</p>

<p>
“It has been ascertained that disturbing the fowl on the feeding flats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
is followed in most cases by their forsaking those haunts, and seeking
others; hence, in the rivers leading to the bay near flying points, they
are never annoyed by boat-shooting, either by night or day, and although
the discharge of guns from the shore may arouse them for a
time, they soon return; whereas a boat or sail in chase a few times,
will make them forsake a favourite spot for days.
</p>

<p>
“From the great number of ducks that are seen in all directions, one
would suppose that there could be no doubt of success at any one
of the points in the course of flight; but whilst they have such correct
vision as to distance, and wide range of space, unless attending
circumstances are favourable, a sportsman may be days without a promising
shot. From the western side of the bay, and it is there the best
grounds are found, the southerly winds are the most favourable; and,
if a high tide is attended by a smart frost and mild south wind, or even
calm morning, the number of birds set in motion becomes inconceivable,
and they approach the points so closely, that even a moderately
good shot can procure from fifty to one hundred ducks a-day.
This has often occurred, and I have seen eight fat Canvass-backs killed
at one discharge into a flock, from a small gun.
</p>

<p>
“To a stranger visiting these waters, the innumerable ducks, feeding
in beds of thousands, or filling the air with their careering, with the
great numbers of beautiful white swans resting near the shores, like
banks of driven snow, might induce him to suppose that the facilities
for their destruction were equal to their profusion, and that with so
large an object in view, a sportsman could scarcely miss his aim.
But, when he considers the great thickness of their covering, the velocity
of their flight, the rapidity and duration of their diving, and the
great influence that circumstances of wind and weather have on the
chances of success, it becomes a matter of wonder how so many are
destroyed.
</p>

<p>
“The usual mode of taking these birds has been, till recently, by shooting
them from the points during their flight, or from the land or boats,
on their feeding grounds, or by <i>toling</i>, as it is strangely termed, an
operation by which the ducks are sometimes induced to approach within
a few feet of the shore, from a distance often of several hundred
yards. A spot is usually selected where the birds have not been much
disturbed, and where they feed at three or four hundred yards from,
and can approach to within forty or fifty yards of the shore, as they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
will never come nearer than they can swim freely. The higher the
tides, and the calmer the day, the better, for they feed closer to the
shores and see more distinctly. Most persons on these waters have a
race of small white or liver-coloured dogs, which they familiarly call
the <i>toler</i> breed, but which appear to be the ordinary poodle.  These
dogs are extremely playful, and are taught to run up and down the
shore, in sight of the ducks, either by the motion of the hand, or by
throwing chips from side to side. They soon become perfectly acquainted
with their business, and as they discover the ducks approaching
them, make their jumps less high till they almost crawl on the
ground, to prevent the birds discovering what the object of their curiosity
may be. This disposition to examine rarities has been taken advantage
of by using a red or black handkerchief by day, and a white
one by night in toling, or even by gently plashing the water on the
shore. The nearest ducks soon notice the strange appearance, raise
their heads, gaze intently for a moment, and then push for the shore,
followed by the rest. On many occasions, I have seen thousands of
them swimming in a solid mass direct to the object; and by removing
the dog farther into the grass, they have been brought within fifteen
feet of the bank. When they have approached to about thirty or forty
yards, their curiosity is generally satisfied, and after swimming up
and down for a few seconds, they retrograde to their former station.
The moment to shoot is while they present their sides, and forty or fifty
ducks have often been killed by a small gun. The Black-heads toll the
most readily, then the Red-heads, next the Canvass-backs, and the Bald-pates
rarely. This also is the ratio of their approach to the points in
flying, although, if the Canvass-back has determined on his direction,
few circumstances will change his course. The total absence of cover
or precaution against exposure to sight, or even a large fire, will not
turn these birds aside on such occasions. In flying-shooting, the Bald-pates
are a great nuisance, for they are so shy that they not only avoid
the points themselves, but by their whistling and confusion of flight at
such times, alarm others.
</p>

<p>
“Simple as it may appear to shoot with success into a solid mass of
ducks sitting on the water at forty or fifty yards’ distance, yet when
you recollect that you are placed nearly level with the surface, the object
opposed to you, even though composed of hundreds of individuals, may
be in appearance but a few feet in width. To give, therefore, the best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
promise of success, old duckers recommend that the <i>nearest</i> duck should
be in perfect relief above the sight, whatever the size of the column,
to avoid the common result of over-shooting. The correctness of this
principle I saw illustrated in an instance in which I had toled to within
a space of from forty to seventy yards off the shore, a bed of certainly
hundreds of ducks. Twenty yards beyond the outside birds of the
dense mass, were five Black-heads, one of which was alone killed out
of the whole number, by a deliberate aim into the <i>middle</i> of the large
flock from a rest, by a heavy well-proved duck-gun.
</p>

<p>
“Before I leave the subject of <i>sitting-shooting</i>, I will mention an occurrence
that took place in Bush River, a few years since. A man
whose house was situated near the bank, on rising early one morning,
observed that the river had frozen, except an open space of ten or twelve
feet in diameter, about eighty yards from the shore, nearly opposite
his house. The spot was full of ducks, and with a heavy gun he fired
into it. Many were killed, and those that flew soon returned, and
were again and again shot at, till, fearful that he was injuring those
already his own, he ceased the massacre, and brought on shore ninety-two
ducks, most of which were Canvass-backs.
</p>

<p>
“To prevent the dogs, whilst toling, from running in, they are not
allowed to go into the water to bring out the ducks, but another breed
of large dogs of the Newfoundland and water-spaniel mixture are employed.
These animals, whilst toling is in progression, or at a point,
take apparently as much interest in success as the sportsman himself.
During a flight, their eyes are incessantly occupied in watching the direction
from whence the birds come; and I have frequently seen them
indicate by their manner, the approach of a flock so distant that the
human eye would have overlooked it. As the ducks come on, the dog
lies down, but still closely observing them, and the moment the discharge
occurs, jumps up to see the effect. If a duck falls dead, they
plunge to bring it; but many of them wait to see <i>how</i> he falls, and
whither he swims, and they seem to be as aware as the gunner, of the
improbability of capture, and will not make the attempt, knowing from
experience that a bird merely winged will generally save himself by
swimming and diving. These dogs usually bring one duck at a time
out of the water; but a real Newfoundland, who was with me and my
company this autumn, was seen on several occasions to swim twenty
yards further, and take a second in the mouth to carry on shore. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
indefatigability and ambition of these animals are remarkable, and a
gentleman informed me he had known his dog bring, in the space of
one hour, twenty Canvass-backs and three Swans from the water, when
the weather was so severe that the animal was covered with icicles,
and to prevent his freezing be took his great-coat to envelope him.
Some dogs will dive a considerable distance after a duck, but a crippled
Canvass-back or Black-head, will swim so far under the water, that they
can rarely be caught by the dog; and it often has been observed, that
the moment one of these ducks, if merely winged, reaches the surface,
he passes under, and however calm, cannot be seen again. To give
an idea of the extreme rapidity with which a duck can dive, I will relate
an occurrence which was noticed by myself, and a similar one was
observed by another of the party the same day. A male South-southerly
was shot at in the water by a percussion-gun, and after escaping the
shot by diving, commenced his flight. When about forty yards from
the boat, he had acquired an elevation of a foot or more from the surface.
A second percussion-gun was discharged, and he dived from the
wing at the flash, and though the spot of entrance was covered by the
shot, soon rose unharmed and flew.
</p>

<p>
“Canvass-backs, when wounded on the streams near the bay, instantly
direct their course for it, and there nestle among the grass on the shores
till cured, or destroyed by eagles, hawks, gulls, foxes, or other vermin,
that are constantly on the search. If a dead Canvass-back be not soon
secured, it becomes a prey to the gulls, which rarely touch any other
kind. I have seen severe contests take place between crippled Canvass-backs
and Gulls; and although a pounce or two generally prevents
further resistance, sometimes they are driven off. If the bird is remarkably
savoury, the gull makes such a noise, that others are soon
collected, when possession is determined by courage or strength.
</p>

<p>
“Another mode of taking Ducks consists in placing gilling-nets under
water on the feeding-grounds, and when they dive for food, their head
and wings become entangled in the meshes, and they are drowned.
This plan, though successful at first, soon drives the bird from these
places; and in some cases, a few applications have entirely prevented
their return for some weeks. Paddling upon them in the night or day
produces the same effect, and although practised to some extent on
Bush River is highly disapproved of by persons shooting from points.
For the last three years a man has been occupied on this stream with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
a gun of great size, fixed on a swivel in a boat, and the destruction of
game on their feeding-flats has been immense; but so unpopular is the
plan, that many schemes have been privately proposed of destroying
his boat and gun, and he has been fired at with balls so often that his
expeditions are at present confined to the night. Sailing with a stiff
breeze upon the geese and swans, or throwing rifle-balls from the shore
into their beds, is sometimes successful.
</p>

<p>
“Moonlight shooting has not been a general practice, but as these
birds are in motion during light nights, they could readily be brought
within range by “honking” them when flying. This sound is very
perfectly imitated at Egg Harbour; and I have seen geese drawn at a
right angle from their course by this note. They can indeed be made
to hover over the spot, and if a captive bird was employed, the success
would become certain.
</p>

<p>
“Notwithstanding the apparent facilities that are offered of success,
the amusement of duck-shooting is probably one of the most exposing
to cold and wet, and those who undertake its enjoyment without a
courage “screwed to the sticking-point”, will soon discover that “to
one good a thousand ills oppose.” It is indeed no parlour sport, for
after creeping through mud and mire, often for hundreds of yards, to
be at last disappointed, and stand exposed on points to the “pelting
rain or more than freezing cold,” for hours, without even the promise
of a shot, would try the patience of even <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>’s “glorious
nibbler.” It is, however, replete with excitement and charm,
and to one who can enter on the pleasure, with a system formed for
polar cold, and a spirit to endure “the weary toil of many a stormy
day,” it will yield a harvest of health and delight, that the “roamer of
the woods” can rarely enjoy.”
</p>

<p>
Although this far-famed bird was named by its discoverer after
the plant <i>Valisneria Americana</i>, on which it partially feeds when on
fresh-water, its subsistence is by no means dependent upon that species,
which indeed is not extensively distributed, but is chiefly derived from
the grass-wrack or Eel-grass, <i>Zostera marina</i>, which is very abundant
on the shallows and flats along the whole sea-coast. Its flesh seems to
me not generally much superior to that of the Pochard or Red-head,
which often mingles in the same flocks; and both species are very frequently
promiscuously sold in the markets as Canvass-backs.
</p>

<p>
In the Plate are represented two Males and a Female. In the back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>

on account of the hospitality which I have there experienced,
and the generosity of its inhabitants, who, on the occasion of a
quantity of my plates having been destroyed by the mob during an
outburst of political feeling, indemnified me for the loss.

The Digestive and Respiratory Organs of a male shot near Baltimore
present the following characters.
</p>

<p>
The upper mandible is broadly and deeply concave. The tongue,
which is thick and fleshy, as in other ducks, is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inches long, its sides
parallel, slightly sloping, and furnished with two series of bristly filaments;
its base with numerous straight conical papillæ directed backwards,
its upper surface marked with a broad median groove, the lower
flat, its extremity formed by a thin semi-circular appendage, a quarter
of an inch in length. The œsophagus passes along the right side of the
neck, for six inches has a diameter of <span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> then dilates to <span class="fract"><span class="fup">9</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, so as to
form a slight crop, again contracts as it enters the thorax, and in terminating
forms the proventriculus, which is <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches in length,
with oblong glandules, generally a twelfth of an inch in length. The
stomach is a very large and powerful gizzard, of a broadly elliptical
form, with extremely thick lateral muscles, the left being <span class="fract"><span class="fup">11</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> in thickness,
the right <span class="fract"><span class="fup">10</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, the tendons large and strong. The transverse diameter
of the gizzard is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">11</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inches, the longitudinal, from the cardiac orifice
to the bulge of the inferior muscle, <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>. Its cuticular lining is of very
dense texture, and rugous; the grinding plates opposite the lateral
muscles about half a twelfth thick, and slightly rugous. The intestine,
which is 5 feet 9 inches in length, first forms in the usual manner the
duodenal fold, at the distance of 5 inches from the pylorus, encloses the
pancreas, receives the biliary ducts, and passing under the right lobe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
of the liver, proceeds backward beneath the kidneys, is convoluted in
several large folds, and finally from above the stomach, passes in a direct
course to the anus. Its coats are thick, its inner surface villous,
and its diameter is considerable, being in the first part of the duodenum
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">9</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, then for two feet from <span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> to <span class="fract"><span class="fup">4</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, enlarged again to <span class="fract"><span class="fup">6</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, and so continuing
to the rectum, which is 6 inches long, <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> inch in diameter, and
ends in an enlargement or cloaca, about an inch in diameter.  The
cœca, which commence at the distance of 6 inches from the anus, are 8
inches long, slender, <span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> in diameter for 3 inches, afterwards about <span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>,
with the extremity obtuse. The œsophagus and stomach contained
young shoots of <i>Zostera marina</i>, and in the latter were numerous particles
of quartz.
</p>

<p>
The trachea, when moderately extended, measures 10 inches in
length, and is furnished with strong lateral or contractor muscles, a
pair of cleido-tracheal, and a pair of more slender sterno-tracheal. Its
diameter at the upper part is <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths, it gradually contracts to <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
twelfths, enlarges to <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths, and at the distance of <span class="mixfract">7&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches from
the upper extremity, forms a dilatation about an inch in length, and
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> in its greatest diameter, but composed of distinct rings, then contracts
to <span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, and ends in a bony and membranous expansion, forming
on the left side an irregular thin disk, convex towards the right, and
flattened towards the left where it is membranous. The expansions
of the trachea are thus similar to those of the Red-breasted Merganser,
but of less extent; the rings are of equal breadth on both sides,
but alternately overlap each other, one side being partially concealed
by the corresponding sides of those above and below it, while the
other stands exposed. The lower larynx is formed of ten united rings,
together with the bony and membranous expansion described. The
tracheal rings, rather broad and osseous, are 118; the half-rings of the
bronchi about 16.

This species, which is known in all parts of the United States by
the name of “Black Duck,” extends its migrations from the Straits of
Belle Isle, on the coast of Labrador, to the province of Texas. Strange
as the fact may appear, it breeds in both these countries, as well as in
many of the intermediate districts. On the 10th of May 1833, I found
it breeding along the marshy edges of inland pools, near the Bay of
Fundy, and, on Whitehead Island in the same bay, saw several young
birds of the same species, which, although apparently not more than a
week old, were extremely active both on land and in the water. On
the 30th of April 1837, my son discovered a nest on Galveston Island,
in Texas. It was formed of grass and feathers, the eggs eight in number,
lying on the former, surrounded with the down and some feathers
of the bird, to the height of about three inches. The internal diameter
of the nest was about six inches, and its walls were nearly three
in thickness. The female was sitting, but flew off in silence as he approached.
The situation selected was a clump of tall slender grass, on
a rather sandy ridge, more than a hundred yards from the nearest water,
but surrounded by partially dried salt-marshes.  On the same
island, in the course of several successive days, we saw many of these
ducks, which, by their actions, shewed that they also had nests. I
may here state my belief, that the Gadwall, Blue-winged Teal, Green-winged
Teal, Mallard, American Widgeon, and Spoon-billed Duck, all
breed in that country, as I observed them there late in May, when they
were evidently paired. How far this fact may harmonize with the
theories of writers respecting the migration of birds in general, is more
than I can at present stop to consider. I have found the Black Duck
breeding on lakes near the Mississippi, as far up as its confluence with
the Ohio, as well as in Pennsylvania and New Jersey; and every one
acquainted with its habits will tell you, that it rears its young in all
the Eastern States intervening between that last mentioned and the St
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
Lawrence, and is of not less frequent occurrence along the margins of
all our great lakes. It is even found on the Columbia River, and on
the streams of the Rocky Mountains; but as Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> has not
mentioned his having observed it in Hudson’s Bay or farther north, we
may suppose that it does not visit those countries.
</p>

<p>
On arriving in Labrador, on the 17th June 1833, we found the Dusky
Ducks in the act of incubation, but for nearly a month after, met with
no young birds, which induced me to suppose that this species does
not reach that country at so early a period as many others, but lingers
behind so as to be nearly four weeks later than some of them. At the
end of four weeks after our arrival, all the females we met with had
young broods, which they led about the fresh-water ponds, and along
their margins, either in search of food, or to secure them from danger.
None of these broods exceeded seven or eight in number, and, at this
early period of their life, we found them covered with long soft down
of a deep brown colour. When alarmed they would dive with great
celerity several times in succession, but soon became fatigued, made
for the shore, ran a few feet from the water, and squatted among the
grass, where they were easily caught either by some of our party, or by
the Gulls, which are constantly on the look-out for such dainty food.
At other times, as soon as the mother apprehends danger, she calls her
young around her, when the little things form themselves into a line
in her wake, and carefully follow her in all her movements. If a Hawk
or a Gull make a plunge towards them, she utters a loud cry of alarm,
and then runs as it were along the surface of the water, when the young
dive as quick as lightning, and do not rise again until they find themselves
among the weeds or the rocks along the shores. When they
thus dive, they separate and pursue different directions, and on reaching
the land lie close among the herbage until assured, by the well-known
voice of their parent, that the danger is over. If they have
often been disturbed in one pond, their anxious mother leads them
overland to another; but she never, I believe, conducts them to the
open sea, until they are able to fly. The young grow with remarkable
rapidity, for, by the middle of August, they almost equal their parents
in size; and their apprehension of danger keeps pace with their growth,
for at the period of their southward migration, which takes place in
the beginning of September, they are as wild and as cunning as the
oldest and most experienced of their species. Each brood migrates
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
separately; and the old males, which abandoned the females when incubation
commenced, set out in groups of eight or ten. Indeed, it is
not common to see birds of this species assemble in such flocks as their
relatives the Mallards, although they at times associate with almost
all the fresh-water Ducks.
</p>

<p>
The males, on leaving the females, join together in small bands,
and retire into the interior of the marshes, where they remain until
their moult is completed. My young friend <span class="smcap">Cooledge</span> brought me a
pair shot on the 4th of July, in Labrador, in so ragged a state that
very few feathers remained even on the wings. On his approaching
them, they skimmed over the surface of the water with such rapidity,
that when shot at they seemed as if flying away.  On examining
these individuals I found them to be sterile, and I am of opinion that
those which are prolific moult at a later period, nature thus giving
more protracted vigour to those which have charge of a young brood.
I think, Reader, you will be of the same opinion, when I have told you,
that on the 5th of July I found some which had young, and which
were still in full plumage, and others, that were broodless, almost destitute
of feathers.
</p>

<p>
As many of the nests found in Labrador differed from the one
mentioned above, I will give you an account of them. In several instances,
we found them imbedded in the deep moss, at the distance of
a few feet or yards from the water. They were composed of a great
quantity of dry grass and other vegetable substances; and the eggs were
always placed directly on this bed without the intervention of the
down and feathers, which, however, surrounded them, and which, as I
observed, the bird always uses to cover them when she is about to leave
the nest for a time. Should she be deprived of her eggs, she goes in
search of a male, and lays another set; but unless a robbery of this
kind happens, she raises only a single brood in the season. But although
this is the case in Labrador, I was assured that this species rears two
broods yearly in Texas, although, having been but a short time in that
country, I cannot vouch for the truth of this assertion. The eggs are
two inches and a quarter in length, one inch and five-eighths in
breadth, shaped like those of the domestic fowl, with a smooth surface,
and of a uniform yellowish-white colour, like that of ivory tarnished
by long exposure. The young, like those of the Mallard, acquire the
full beauty of their spring plumage before the season of reproduction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
commences, but exhibit none of the curious changes which that species
undergoes.
</p>

<p>
Although the Dusky Duck is often seen on salt-water bays or
inlets, it resembles the Mallard in its habits, being fond of swampy
marshes, rice-fields, and the shady margins of our rivers, during the
whole of its stay in such portions of the Southern States as it is
known to breed in. They are equally voracious, and may sometimes
be seen with their crops so protruded as to destroy the natural elegance
of their form. They devour, with the greatest eagerness, water-lizards,
young frogs and toads, tadpoles, all sorts of insects, acorns, beech nuts,
and every kind of grain that they can obtain. They also, at times,
seize on small quadrupeds, gobble up earth-worms and leeches, and when
in salt water, feed on shell-fish. When on the water, they often procure
their food by immersing their head and neck, and, like the Mallard,
sift the produce of muddy pools. Like that species also, they
will descend in a spiral manner from on high, to alight under an oak
or a beech, when they have discovered the mast to be abundant.
</p>

<p>
Shy and vigilant, they are with difficulty approached by the gunner,
unless under cover or on horseback, or in what sportsmen call floats, or
shallow boats made for the purpose of procuring water-fowl. They
are, however, easily caught in traps set on the margins of the waters
to which they resort, and baited with Indian corn, rice, or other grain.
They may also be enticed to wheel round, and even alight, by imitating
their notes, which, in both sexes, seem to me almost precisely to resemble
those of the Mallard. From that species, indeed, they scarcely
differ in external form, excepting in wanting the curiously recurved
feathers of the tail, which Nature, as if clearly to distinguish the two
species, had purposely omitted in them.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this Duck, which, in as far as I know, is peculiar to
America, is powerful, rapid, and as sustained as that of the Mallard.
While travelling by day they may be distinguished from that species by
the whiteness of their lower wing-coverts, which form a strong contrast
to the deep tints of the rest of their plumage, and which I have attempted
to represent in the figure of the female bird in my plate. Their progress
through the air, when at full speed, must, I think, be at the rate
of more than a mile in a minute, or about seventy miles in an hour.
When about to alight, they descend with double rapidity, causing a
strong rustling sound by the weight of their compact body and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
rapid movements of their pointed wings. When alarmed by a shot or
otherwise, they rise off their feet by a single powerful spring, fly directly
upwards for eight or ten yards, and then proceed in a straight
line. Now, if you are an expert hand, is the moment to touch your
trigger, and if you delay, be sure your shot will fall short.
</p>

<p>
As it is attached to particular feeding grounds, and returns to them
until greatly molested, you may, by secreting yourself within shooting
distance, anticipate a good result; for even although shot at, it will
reappear several times in succession in the course of a few hours, unless
it has been wounded. The gunners in the vicinity of Boston, in
Massachusetts, who kill great numbers of these birds, on account of
the high price obtained for them in the fine market of that beautiful
and hospitable city, procure them in the following manner:—They
keep live decoy-ducks of the Mallard kind, which they take with them
in their floats or boats. On arriving at a place which they know to be
suitable, they push or haul their boat into some small nook, and conceal
it among the grass or rushes. Then they place their decoys, one
in front of their ambush, the rest on either side, each having a line attached
to one of its feet, with a stone at the other end, by which it is kept
as if riding at anchor. One of the birds is retained in the boat, where
the gunner lies concealed, and in cold weather amply covered with
thick and heavy clothing. No sooner is all in order, than the decoy-ducks,
should some wild birds appear, sound their loud call-notes,
anxious as they feel to be delivered from their sad bondage. Should
this fail to produce the desired effect of drawing the wild ducks near,
the poor bird in the boat is pinched on the rump, when it immediately
calls aloud; those at anchor respond, and the joint clamour attracts
the travellers, who now check their onward speed, wheel several times
over the spot, and at last alight. The gunner seldom waits long for a
shot, and often kills fifteen or twenty of the Black Ducks at a single
discharge of his huge piece, which is not unfrequently charged with as
much as a quarter of a pound of powder and three quarters of a pound
of shot!
</p>

<p>
The Black Ducks generally appear in the sound of Long Island
in September or October, but in very cold weather proceed southward;
while those which breed in Texas, as I have been informed, remain
there all the year. At their first arrival they betake themselves to
the fresh-water ponds, and soon become fat, when they afford excellent 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
eating; but when the ponds are covered with ice, and they are
forced to betake themselves to estuaries or inlets of the sea, their
flesh becomes less juicy and assumes a fishy flavour. During continued
frost they collect into larger bodies than at any other time, a
flock once alighted seeming to attract others, until at last hundreds
of them meet, especially in the dawn and towards sunset. The larger
the flock however, the more difficult it is to approach it, for many
sentinels are seen on the look-out, while the rest are asleep or feeding
along the shores. Unlike the “Sea Ducks,” this species does not ride
at anchor, as it were, during its hours of repose.
</p>

<p>
My friend, the Reverend Dr <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, assures me that this
bird, which some years ago was rather scarce in South Carolina, is
now becoming quite abundant in that state, where, during autumn and
winter, it resorts to the rice fields. After feeding a few weeks on the
seeds it becomes fat, juicy, and tender. He adds that the farther inland,
the more plentifully does it occur, which may be owing to the
many steamers that ply on the rivers along the sea coast, where very
few are to be seen. They are however followed in their retreats, and
shot in great numbers, so that the markets of Charleston are now amply
supplied with them. He also informs me that he has known hybrid
broods produced by a male of this species and the common domestic
duck; and that he had three of these hybrid females, the eggs of all
of which were productive. The young birds were larger than either of
their parents, but although they laid eggs in the course of the following
spring, not one of these proved impregnated. He further states
that he procured three nests of the Dusky Duck in the State of New
York.
</p>

<p>
The young of this species, in the early part of autumn, afford delicious
eating, and, in my estimation, are much superior in this respect
to the more celebrated Canvass-back Duck. That the species should
not before now have been brought into a state of perfect domestication,
only indicates our reluctance unnecessarily to augment the comforts
which have been so bountifully accorded by Nature to the inhabitants
of our happy country. In our eastern markets the price of these
birds is from a dollar to a dollar and fifty cents the pair. They are dearer
at New Orleans, but much cheaper in the States of Ohio and Kentucky,
where they are still more abundant. Their feathers are elastic, and
as valuable as those of any other species.

<h2>
BARTRAMIAN SANDPIPER.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Totanus Bartramius</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The Bartramian Sandpiper is the most truly terrestrial of its tribe
with which I am acquainted. It is even more inclined, at all seasons,
to keep away from the water, than the Kildeer Plover, which may often
be seen wading in shallow pools, or searching along the sandy or
muddy margins of the shores of the sea, or of fresh-water lakes and
streams. Although not unfrequently met with in the vicinity of such
places, it never ventures to wade into them; and yet the form and
length of its legs and feet would naturally induce a person not acquainted
with its habits to consider it as a wading bird.
</p>

<p>
The dry upland plains of those sections of Louisiana called Opellousas
and Attacapas, are amply peopled with this species in early
spring, as well as in autumn. They arrive there from the vast prairies
of Texas and Mexico, where they spend the winter, in the beginning
of March, or about the period of the first appearance of the Martins,
<i>Hirundo purpurea</i>, and return about the first of August. They are
equally abundant on all the western prairies on either side of the Missouri,
where, however, they arrive about a month later than in Louisiana,
whence they disperse over the United States, reaching the middle
districts early in May, and the State of Maine by the middle of that
month, or about the same period at which they are seen in Indiana,
Kentucky, and Ohio. Some proceed as far north as the plains adjoining
the Saskatchewan River, where Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> met with this species
in the month of May.
</p>

<p>
It has been supposed that the Bartramian Sandpiper never forms large
flocks, but this is not correct, for in the neighbourhood of New Orleans,
where it is called the “Papabote,” it usually arrives in great bands in
spring, and is met with on the open plains and large grassy savannahs,
where it generally remains about two weeks, though sometimes individuals
may be seen as late as the 15th of May. I have observed the
same circumstances on our western prairies, but have thought that
they were afterwards obliged to separate into small flocks, or even into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
pairs, as soon as they are ready to seek proper places for breeding in,
for I have seldom found more than two pairs with nests or young in
the same field or piece of ground. On their first arrival, they are generally
thin, but on their return southward, in the beginning of August,
when they tarry in Louisiana until the first of October, they are
fat and juicy. I have observed, that in spring, when they are poor,
they are usually much less shy than in autumn, when they are exceedingly
wary and difficult of approach; but this general observation is not
without exceptions, and the difference, I think, depends on the nature
of the localities in which they happen to be found at either period.
When on newly ploughed fields, which they are fond of frequenting,
they see a person at a greater distance than when they are searching
for food among the slender grasses of the plains. I have also thought
that the size of the flocks may depend upon similar contingencies, for
this bird is by no means fond of the society of man.
</p>

<p>
Like the Spotted Sandpiper, <i>Totanus macularius</i>, they not unfrequently
alight on fences, trees, and out-houses; but whether in such
situations or on the ground, they seldom settle without raising both
wings upright to their full extent, and uttering their loud and prolonged,
but pleasing notes. They run with great activity, stop suddenly,
and vibrate their body once or twice. When earnestly followed
by the sportsman, they lower their heads in the manner of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s
Plover, and the species called the Piping, and run off rapidly, or squat,
according to the urgency of the occasion. At other times, they partially
extend their wings, run a few steps as if about to fly, and then
cunningly move off sideways, and conceal themselves among the grass,
or behind a clod. You are not unfrequently rendered aware of your
being within sight of them, by unexpectedly hearing their plaintive
and mellow notes, a circumstance, however, which I always concluded
to be indicative of the wariness of their disposition, for although you
have just heard those well-known cries, yet, on searching for the bird,
you nowhere see it, for the cunning creature has slipped away and hid
itself. When wounded in the wing, they run to a great distance, and
are rarely found.
</p>

<p>
Like all experienced travellers, they appear to accommodate themselves
to circumstances as regards their food, for in Louisiana, they
feed on cantharides and other coleopterous insects; in Massachusetts on
grasshoppers, on which my friend <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> says, they soon grow very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
fat; in the Carolinas on crickets and other insects, as well as the seeds
of the crab-grass, <i>Digitaria sanguinaria</i>; and in the barrens of Kentucky
they often pick the strawberries. Those which feed much on
cantharides, require to be very carefully cleaned, otherwise persons
eating them are liable to suffer severely. Several gentlemen of New
Orleans have assured me, that they have seen persons at dinner obliged
to leave the room at once, under such circumstances, which cannot
well be described here. When flavoured with the ripe strawberries,
on which they have fed, their flesh is truly delicious.
</p>

<p>
This species performs its migrations by night as well as by day.
Its flight is rather swift and well sustained. While travelling, it generally
flies so high as to be beyond reach of the gun: but if the weather
be cloudy, or if it blow hard, it flies lower, and may easily be shot.
It generally proceeds in straggling bands, and moves along with continuous
easy beats of the wings, but sails, as it were, when about to
alight, as well as during the love season.
</p>

<p>
As long ago as 1805 and 1806, I observed this species breeding in
the meadows and green-fields of my plantation of Millgrove, near the
banks of Perkioming Creek. Since then, I have known of its rearing
broods in different parts of Pennsylvania, in the State of New York,
and in various districts to the eastward as far as the confines of Maine;
but I did not find it in Newfoundland or Labrador; and I have reason
to believe that it does not breed to the south of Maryland.
</p>

<p>
My friend, the Rev. Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, has informed me that the Bartramian
Sandpiper makes its appearance in South Carolina about the 15th
of July, the hottest period of the year, in considerable numbers, betakes
itself at once to the high grassy lands, and there remains about a
month. He considers it to be then on its return from the north, and
states that it is very fat and affords delicious food. His manner of shooting
them is, to ride in a chair or gig over the fields which they frequent,
or along the roads in their neighbourhood, by which means they can
be approached near enough to enable the sportsman to shoot with almost
a certainty of success, as the bird rises out of the grass. If one
attempts to get near them on foot, they rise at too great a distance,
then sweep in circles over the spot, and alight a considerable way off.
They are seldom met with there in flocks of more than four or five individuals.
</p>

<p>
I have found the eggs of this bird laid on the bare earth, in a hollow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
scooped out to the depth of about an inch and a half, near the roots of
a tuft of rank grass, in the middle of a meadow, and seen some nests
of the same species formed of loosely arranged grasses, and placed almost
beneath low bushes growing on poor elevated ridges, furnished with
a scanty vegetation. I have also heard my esteemed young friend, <span class="smcap">John
Trudeau</span>, state that he had discovered one on a high part of the bank of
the Delaware River. When disturbed while on its nest, but unobserved,
it runs thirty or forty yards, and then flies off as if severely wounded.
Should it have young, its attempts to decoy you away are quite enough
to induce you to desist from harassing it. The eggs measure an inch and
five and a half eighths, by an inch and a quarter in their greatest
breadth. In form they resemble those of <i>Totanus macularius</i>, being
broadly rounded at one end, and rather pointed at the other; their surface
smooth; their ground colour dull greyish-yellow, with numerous spots of
light purple and reddish-brown. They are placed in the nest in the same
manner as those of the Spotted Sandpiper, that is, with the smaller
ends together, which is also the case with those of the Tell-tale Godwit,
Wilson’s Plover, and the Kildeer Plover. The young, which run about
immediately after exclusion, grow rapidly, and in about a month are
able to use their wings, after which, they and their parents gradually,
and according to the temperature of the season, move southward.
</p>

<p>
In Massachusetts, and to the eastward of that state, this species is
best known by the name of “Upland Plover,” and in some other districts
it is named the Field Plover. The drawing from which the plate
was engraved was taken from individuals shot near Bayou Sara, in the
State of Mississippi.

<h2>
TURNSTONE.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Strepsilas Interpres</i>, Illiger.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCIV. Adult in Summer and Winter.</span>
</p>


<p>
This bird, which, in its full vernal dress, is one of the most beautiful
of its family, is found along the southern coasts of the United
States during winter, from North Carolina to the mouth of the Sabine
River, in considerable numbers, although perhaps as many travel at
that season into Texas and Mexico, where I observed it on its journey
eastward, from the beginning of April to the end of May 1837. I procured
many specimens in the course of my rambles along the shores of
the Florida Keys, and in the neighbourhood of St Augustine, and have
met with it in May and June, as well as in September and October, in
almost every part of our maritime shores, from Maine to Maryland.
On the coast of Labrador I looked for it in vain, although Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>
mentions their arrival at their breeding quarters on the shores
of Hudson’s Bay and the Arctic Sea up to the seventy-fifth parallel.
</p>

<p>
In spring the Turnstone is rarely met with in flocks exceeding five
or six individuals, but often associates with other species, such as the
Knot, the Red-backed Sandpiper, and the <i>Tringa subarquata</i>. Towards
the end of autumn, however, they collect into large flocks,
and so continue during the winter. I have never seen it on the
margins of rivers or lakes, but always on the shores of the sea,
although it prefers those of the extensive inlets so numerous on
our coasts. At times it rambles to considerable distances from the
beach, for I have found it on rocky islands thirty miles from the mainland;
and on two occasions, whilst crossing the Atlantic, I saw several
flocks near the Great Banks flying swiftly, and rather close to the water
around the ships, after which they shot off toward the south-west, and
in a few minutes were out of sight. It seems to be a hardy bird, for
some of them remain in our Eastern Districts until severe frost prevails.
Having seen some, in the beginning of June, and in superb
plumage, on the high grounds of the Island of Grand Mannan, in the
Bay of Fundy, I supposed that they bred there, although none of my
party succeeded in discovering their nests. Indeed the young, as I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
have been informed, are obtained there, and along the coast of Maine,
in the latter part of July.
</p>

<p>
I have found this bird much more shy when in company with other
species than when in flocks by itself, when it appears to suspect no
danger from man. Many instances of this seeming inattention have
occurred to me, among others the following:—When I was on the
island of Galveston in Texas, my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, my son, and
some others of our party, had shot four deer, which the sailors had
brought to our little camp near the shore. Feeling myself rather fatigued,
I did not return to the bushes with the rest, who went in search
of more venison for our numerous crew, but proposed, with the assistance
of one of the sailors, to skin the deer. After each animal was
stripped of its hide, and deprived of its head and feet, which were
thrown away, the sailor and I took it to the water and washed it. To
my surprise, I observed four Turnstones directly in our way to the
water. They merely ran to a little distance out of our course, and on
our returning, came back immediately to the same place; this they
did four different times, and, after we were done, they remained busily
engaged in searching for food. None of them was more than fifteen
or twenty yards distant, and I was delighted to see the ingenuity with
which they turned over the oyster-shells, clods of mud, and other small
bodies left exposed by the retiring tide. Whenever the object was
not too large, the bird bent its legs to half their length, placed its bill
beneath it, and with a sudden quick jerk of the head pushed it off,
when it quickly picked up the food which was thus exposed to view,
and walked deliberately to the next shell to perform the same operation.
In several instances, when the clusters of oyster-shells or clods
of mud were too heavy to be removed in the ordinary way, they would
use not only the bill and head, but also the breast, pushing the object
with all their strength, and reminding me of the labour which I have
undergone in turning over a large turtle. Among the sea-weeds that
had been cast on the shore, they used only the bill, tossing the garbage
from side to side, with a dexterity extremely pleasant to behold. In
this manner, I saw these four Turnstones examine almost every part
of the shore along a space of from thirty to forty yards; after which I
drove them away, that our hunters might not kill them on their return.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, when in company with Mr <span class="smcap">Harris</span>, and on
the same island I witnessed the same pleasing proceeding, several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
Turnstones being engaged in searching for food in precisely the same
manner. At other times, and especially when in the neighbourhood of
St Augustine, in East Florida, I used to amuse myself with watching
these birds on the racoon-oyster banks, using my glass for the purpose.
I observed that they would search for such oysters as had been killed
by the heat of the sun, and pick out their flesh precisely in the manner
of our Common Oyster-catcher, <i>Hæmatopus palliatus</i>, while they
would strike at such small bivalves as had thin shells, and break them,
as I afterwards ascertained, by walking to the spot. While on the
Florida coast, near Cape Sable, I shot one in the month of May, that
had its stomach filled with those beautiful shells, which, on account of
their resemblance to grains of rice, are commonly named rice-shells.
</p>

<p>
I have always looked upon the Turnstone, while at its avocations,
as a species very nearly allied to the Oyster-catcher; and, although it
certainly differs in some particulars, were I to place it in a position
determined by its affinities, I should remove it at once from the Tringa
family. Its mode of searching for food around pebbles and other objects,
the comparative strength of its legs, its retiring disposition, and
its loud whistling notes while on wing, will, I think, prove at some
period that what I have ventured to advance may be in accordance
with the only true system, by which I mean Nature’s own system,
could one be so fortunate as to understand it.
</p>

<p>
While this species remains in the United States, although its residence
is protracted to many months, very few individuals are met with
in as complete plumage as the one represented in my plate with the
wings fully extended; for out of a vast number of specimens procured
from the beginning of March to the end of May, or from August to
May, I have scarcely found two to correspond precisely in their markings.
For this reason, no doubt exists in my mind that this species, as well
as the Knot and several others, loses its rich summer plumage soon
after the breeding season, when the oldest become scarcely distinguishable
from the young. In the spring months, however, I have observed
that they gradually improve in beauty, and acquire full-coloured feathers
in patches on the upper and lower surfaces of the body, in the
same manner as the Knot, the Red-breasted Snipe, the Godwits, and
several other species. According to Mr <span class="smcap">Hewitson</span>, the eggs are four in
number, rather suddenly pointed towards the smaller end, generally an
inch and four and a half eighths in length, an inch and one and a half
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
eighths in their greatest breadth, their ground colour pale yellowish-green,
marked with irregular patches and streaks of brownish-red, and
a few lines of black.
</p>

<p>
My drawing of the Turnstones represented in the plate was made
at Philadelphia, in the end of May 1824; and the beautiful specimen
exhibited in the act of flying, I procured near Camden, while in the
agreeable company of my talented friend <span class="smcap">Le Sueur</span>, who, alas! is now
no more.
</p>

<p>
I have not observed any remarkable difference in the plumage of
the sexes at any season of the year. The males I have generally
found to be somewhat larger than the females, which, as is well known,
is not the case in the Tringa family.
</p>

<p>
My worthy friend, Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, once had a bird of this species
alive. It had recovered from a slight wound in the wing, when he
presented it to a lady, a friend of his and mine, who, fed it on boiled
rice, and bread soaked in milk, of both of which it was very fond. It
continued in a state of captivity upwards of a year, but was at last
killed by accident. It had become perfectly gentle, would eat from
the hand of its kind mistress, frequently bathed in a basin placed near
it for the purpose, and never attempted to escape, although left quite
at liberty to do so.

<h2>
PURPLE GALLINULE.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Gallinula martinica</i>, Lath</span>.
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCV. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
Reader, although you may think it strange, I candidly assure you
that I have experienced a thousand times more pleasure while looking
at the Purple Gallinule flirting its tail while gaily moving over the
broad leaves of the water-lily, than I have ever done while silently
sitting in the corner of a crowded apartment, gazing on the flutterings
of gaudy fans and the wavings of flowing plumes. Would that I were
once more extended on some green grassy couch, in my native
Louisiana, or that I lay concealed under some beautiful tree, overhanging
the dark bayou, on whose waters the bird of beauty is wont
to display its graceful movements, and the rich hues of its glossy
plumage! Methinks I now see the charming creature gliding sylph-like
over the leaves that cover the lake, with the aid of her lengthened
toes, so admirably adapted for the purpose, and seeking the mate, who,
devotedly attached as he is, has absented himself, perhaps in search of
some secluded spot in which to place their nest. Now he comes,
gracefully dividing the waters of the tranquil pool, his frontal crest
glowing with the brightest azure. Look at his wings, how elegantly
they are spread and obliquely raised; see how his expanded tail
strikes the water; and mark the movements of his head, which is alternately
thrown backward and forward, as if he were congratulating
his mate on their happy meeting. Now both birds walk along clinging
to the stems and blades, their voices clearly disclosing their mutual
feelings of delight, and they retire to some concealed place on the nearest
shore, where we lose sight of them for a time.
</p>

<p>
Now, side by side, they look for the most secure spot among the
tall rushes that border the lake, and there they will soon form a
nest, removed alike from danger to be dreaded from the inhabitants of
the land as of the water. On the thick mass of withered leaves are
deposited the precious eggs, from which in time emerge the dusky
younglings, that presently betake themselves to the water, over which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
they wander, guided by their affectionate parent, until it becomes expedient
for the party to disperse.
</p>

<p>
The Purple Gallinule is a constant resident in the United States,
although peculiar to their southern districts, where I have met with it
at all seasons. It is in the Floridas, the lower parts of Alabama, and
among the broad marshes bordering the Gulf of Mexico, in Lower
Louisiana, that I have observed its habits. Beyond the Carolinas
eastward, it is only met with as an accidental straggler. It never, I
believe, ascends the Mississippi beyond Memphis, where indeed it is
but rarely seen; but between Natchez and the mouths of the great
river, it is abundant on all the retired bayous and small lakes. The
southern portions of Georgia are also furnished with it; but in South
Carolina it is rare. Proceeding southwestward along the Gulf of
Mexico, I have found it as far as Texas, where it breeds, as well as in
Louisiana, where I observed it coming from the south in May 1837.
</p>

<p>
Having studied the habits of this bird under every advantage in
Louisiana, and especially in the neighbourhood of New Orleans, and
the mouths of the Mississippi, I will now, good Reader, place before
you the results of my observation. In the summer months, the Purple
Gallinules remove with their broods to the prairies or large savannahs
bordering the bayous or lakes on which they have bred, and remain in
those places, which are generally covered with thick and tall grass,
until the beginning of September, when the vegetation having been
dried up by the intense heat and drought, neither food nor sufficient
concealment can be obtained. The young birds usually abandon these
plains first, and while the colour of their plumage is still green, instead
of purplish-blue, which tint, however, is assumed before the return of
spring. During all this while, its notes are as frequently heard as
during the breeding season. They resemble the delicate whistling
sounds of the Blue-winged Teal during its residence with us. At this
season also its flesh is best, although it never equals that of the Freshwater
Marsh-hen, <i>Rallus elegans</i>, or of the Sora Rail, <i>Rallus carolinus</i>.
</p>

<p>
On the approach of winter, all the Purple Gallinules leave the savannahs,
and betake themselves to the immediate vicinity of ponds,
bayous, or rivers, where through experience they become shy, vigilant,
and cunning. They seldom remove from one place to another, or travel
at all, unless by night, although in sequestered parts they feed both
on land and on the water by day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Purple Gallinule breeds at a remarkably early period of the
year. I have found young birds in their jetty down clothing in February,
and they have been observed in the same month by the keepers
of the lighthouse at the south-west Pass of the Mississippi, at Key
West, and in other places. The parent birds are sometimes so very
intent on saving their young, as to suffer themselves to be caught. At
this period their calls are almost incessantly heard during the whole
night, and are elicited during the day by any musical or remarkable
noise. The nest is generally placed among a kind of rushes that are
green at all seasons, round, very pithy, rarely more than five feet high,
and grow more along the margins of ponds than in the water itself.
The birds gather many of them, and fasten them at the height of two
or three feet, and there the nest is placed. It is composed of the
most delicate rushes, whether green or withered, and is quite as substantial
as that of the Common Gallinule, flattish, having an internal diameter
of eight or ten inches, while the entire breadth is about fifteen.
The eggs, which are from five to seven, rarely more, are very similar
to those of the Common Gallinule, being of a light greyish-yellow,
spotted with blackish-brown. The young are at first quite black, and
covered with down. They are fully fledged by the first of June, when,
as I have said, they and their parents remove to the wet savannahs in
the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
The jerking motions of the tail of this bird, whenever it is disturbed,
or attracted by any remarkable object, are very quick, and so often repeated
as to have a curious appearance. It runs with great speed, and
dives with equal address, often moving off under water with nothing
but the bill above. The lightness and ease with which it walks on the
floating plants are surprising, for in proceeding they scarcely produce
any perceptible disturbance of the water. When swimming in full security,
they move buoyantly and gracefully, throwing the head forward
at every propelling motion of the feet. The flight of this species is less
swift than that of the Common Gallinule, or of the Rails, unless when it
is travelling far, when it flies high, and advances in a direct course by
continued flappings; but when it is in its breeding or feeding grounds,
its flight is slow and short, seldom exceeding thirty or forty yards, and
with the legs hanging down; and it alights among the herbage with
its wings spread upwards in the manner of the Rails. It often alights
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
on the low branches of trees and bushes growing over the water, and
walks lightly and gracefully over them.
</p>

<p>
It is seldom that more than one Purple Gallinule is shot at a time,
unless in the beginning of the love season, when the male and female
are apt to swim or walk close together. The male at this period is
said to be able to inflate the frontal plate while strutting, but I have
never been fortunate enough to observe this.
</p>

<p>
The Purple Gallinule not unfrequently alights on ships at sea.
While at the Island of Galveston, on the 26th of April, I was offered
several live individuals by the officers of the Boston frigate, which they
had caught on board. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> once received three
specimens that had been caught three hundred miles from land, one of
them having come through the cabin window. He also obtained from
the Hon. Mr <span class="smcap">Poinset</span> a fine specimen caught on board, on the Santee
River, in South Carolina, in May. It is easily kept alive if fed with
bread soaked in milk; and on this food I have known several that remained
in good health for years. In Louisiana, where it is called <i>Rale
Bleu</i>, its flesh is not held in much estimation, but is used by the negroes
for making gombo.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> considers this species as rather scarce in South
Carolina and Georgia, but states that it breeds there, as he has occasionally
observed pairs on the head waters or preserves of rice plantations
during summer, but never met with any in winter. The extreme
limit of its range eastward is the neighbourhood of Boston, where a few
individuals have been procured.
</p>

<p>
I think I may safely tell you that the figure of the Purple Gallinule
exhibited in the plate, is the first ever published from a drawing taken
from Nature!

<h2>
GREAT NORTHERN DIVER OR LOON.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">

<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCVI. Adult Male and Young Male</span>.
</p>


<p>
The Loon, as this interesting species of Diver is generally called
in the United States, is a strong, active, and vigilant bird. When it
has acquired its perfect plumage, which is not altered in colour at any
successive moult, it is really a beautiful creature; and the student of
Nature who has opportunities of observing its habits, cannot fail to derive
much pleasure from watching it as it pursues its avocations. View
it as it buoyantly swims over the heaving billows of the Atlantic, or
as it glides along deeply immersed, when apprehensive of danger, on
the placid lake, on the grassy islet of which its nest is placed; calculate,
if you can, the speed of its flight, as it shoots across the sky;
mark the many plunges it performs in quest of its finny food, or in
eluding its enemies; list to the loud and plaintive notes which it issues,
either to announce its safety to its mate, or to invite some traveller of
its race to alight, and find repose and food; follow the anxious and
careful mother-bird, as she leads about her precious charge; and you
will not count your labour lost, for you will have watched the ways of
one of the wondrous creations of unlimited Power and unerring Wisdom.
You will find pleasure too in admiring the glossy tints of its
head and neck, and the singular regularity of the unnumbered spots
by which its dusky back and wings are checkered.
</p>

<p>
I have met with the Great Diver, in winter, on all the water-courses
of the United States, whence, however, it departs when the
cold becomes extreme, and the surface is converted into an impenetrable
sheet of ice. I have seen it also along the whole of our Atlantic
coast, from Maine to the extremity of Florida, and from thence to
the mouths of the Mississippi, and the shores of Texas, about Galveston
Island, where some individuals in the plumage characteristic of the
second moult, were observed in the course of my late expedition, in
the month of April 1837. Indeed, as is the case with most other species
of migrating birds, the young remove farther south that the old individuals,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
which are better able to withstand the cold and tempests of
the wintry season.
</p>

<p>
The migratory movements of this bird seem to be differently managed
in the spring and autumn. In the latter case, a great number of
young Loons are seen to alight on the head waters of our great streams,
on which, without much exertion, being aided by the current, they
float along, diving at intervals in pursuit of the numerous fishes, as
they proceed toward milder climes. The few old birds which, at a
later date, appear on the same water-courses, frequently take to wing,
and shorten their way by flying at a considerable elevation directly
across the great bends or peninsulas. These modes of travelling are
also adopted by those which advance along the Atlantic coasts, where,
indeed, the birds have the double advantage of meeting with food and
obtaining repose, on the rivers and on the sea. I think, however, that
this maritime course is followed only by such of the Loons as have
bred in the more immediate vicinity of the coast. But whether you
are in the interior, or on the coast, it is seldom that you see at a time
more than one Loon travelling at this season; whereas, in spring, they
proceed in pairs, the male taking the lead, as is easily ascertained by
observing that the bird in the rear is the smallest.
</p>

<p>
Although, its wings are rather small, its flight is strong and rapid,
so that it is enabled to traverse a large extent of country on wing.
When travelling, or even when only raised from its nest, it moves
through the air with all the swiftness of the other species of its tribe,
generally passing directly from one point to another, however distant
it may be. Its long transits are at times performed at so great an elevation,
that its form can scarcely be distinguished, and yet, even then,
in calm weather, the noise of its wings striking the air comes distinctly
on your ear. I have seen them thus, on their way towards Labrador,
passing over the head waters of the Bay of Fundy, to cross the Gulf
of St Lawrence. Whenever it chances to alight on the water, in the
course of its long journeys, it almost immediately dives, as if to taste
the water, and judge whether it contains food suited to its appetite.
On emerging, and after having somewhat raised the fore part of its
body, shaken its wings, and by a strong shiver rearranged its plumage,
it emits its loud echoing call-note, to induce, perchance, some traveller
of its tribe to alight for awhile, that they may communicate to each
other their experience of the past, or their hopes of the future. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
is an absurd notion, entertained by persons unacquainted with the nature
of this bird, that its plaintive cries are a sure indication of violent
storms. Sailors, in particular, are ever apt to consider these call-notes
as portentous. In the course of a voyage from Charleston to the
Florida Keys, in May 1832, I several times saw and heard Loons travelling
eastward; but, notwithstanding all the dire forebodings of the
crew, who believed that a hurricane was at hand, our passage was exceedingly
pleasant. Although I have heard the notes of the Loon in
rainy and blowy weather, yet I never heard them so frequent or so
loud, both by day and by night, as on the Ohio, during that delightful
and peculiarly American autumnal season called the Indian Summer;
when, although not so much as a cloud was seen for weeks, I have frequently
observed the passing birds checking their flight, or heard the
murmuring plash which they produced on alighting upon the placid
water, to rest and refresh themselves.
</p>

<p>
Another strange notion, not deserving of credit, although you will
find it gravely announced in books, is that, when the Loon is breeding,
it will dart down suddenly from the air, and alight securely in its nest.
I have never witnessed such a procedure, although I have closely
watched, from under cover, at least, twenty pairs. On such occasions
I have seen the incubating bird pass over the dear spot several times
in succession, gradually rounding and descending so as at last to
alight obliquely on the water, which it always did at a considerable
distance from the nest, and did not approach it until after glancing
around and listening attentively, as if to assure itself that it was not
watched, when it would swim to the shore, and resume its office.
</p>

<p>
The Loon breeds in various parts of the United States, from Maryland
to Maine. I have ascertained that it nestles in the former of these
States, on the Susquehannah river, as well as in the districts between
Kentucky and Canada, and on our great lakes. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states
that it is found breeding as far north as the 70th degree of latitude.
The situation and form of the nest differ according to circumstances.
Some of those which breed in the State of Maine, place it on the hillocks
of weeds and mud prepared by the musk-rat, on the edges of the
lakes, or at some distance from them among the rushes. Other nests,
found on the head-waters of the Wabash River, were situated on the
mud, amid the rank weeds, more than ten yards from the water.
Authors have said that only one pair breed on a lake; but I have found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
three pairs, with their nests, on a pond not exceeding a quarter of a
mile in length, in the State of Maine. One that I saw after the young
had left it, on Cayuga Lake, in 1824, was almost afloat, and rudely attached
to the rushes, more than forty yards from the land, though its
base was laid on the bottom, the water being eight or nine inches
deep. Others examined in Labrador were placed on dry land, several
yards from the water, and raised to the height of nearly a foot above
the decayed moss on which they were laid. But, in cases when the
nest was found at any distance from the water, we discovered a well-beaten
path leading to it, and very much resembling those made by the
Beaver, to which the hunters give the name of “crawls.” The nest,
wherever placed, is bulky, and formed of the vegetable substances
found in the immediate vicinity, such as fresh or withered grasses and
herbaceous plants. The internal part, or the true nest, which is rarely
less than a foot, and is sometimes fifteen inches, in diameter, is raised
upon the external or inferior mass, to the height of seven or eight
inches. Such was one found on the 5th July 1835, in Labrador, and
which was placed within three yards of the edge of a considerable
pond of limpid water, supposed to have been produced by the melting
of the snow, and upwards of a mile distant from the sea. Of
the many nests which I have examined, I have found more containing
three than two eggs, and I am confident that the former number is
that which more frequently occurs, although many European, and some
American writers, who probably never saw a nest of this bird, allege
the contrary. The eggs average three inches and three quarters in
length, by two inches and a quarter in their greatest breadth, and thus
are considerably elongated, being particularly narrowed from the bulge
to the smaller end, which is rather pointed. They are of a dull greenish-ochry
tint, rather indistinctly marked with spots of dark umber,
which are more numerous toward the larger extremity. The weight
of two of these eggs, containing young nearly ready to emerge, was
ten ounces and a half. In Maine the Loon lays fully a month earlier
than in Labrador, and about the same period as on the Wabash.
</p>

<p>
On approaching the female while sitting on her eggs, I assured myself
that she incubates with her body laid flat upon them, in the same
way as the Domestic Duck, and that, on perceiving the intruder, she
squats close, and so remains until he is almost over her, when she
springs up with great force, and makes at once for the water, in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
scrambling and sliding manner, pushing herself along the ground. On
gaining the water, she dives at once, emerges at a great distance, and
very rarely suffers herself to be approached within gunshot. Sometimes
they swim so deeply immersed as scarcely to be perceptible, and
keep as much as possible among the rushes and other water plants.
When the eggs are on the eve of being hatched, the mother, when disturbed,
often cries loudly and dismally for some time, but seldom flies
off. At other times, when I found the eggs to have been recently laid,
the bird, on reaching the water, and diving, swam lightly, flapping its
wings, drank once or twice, and moved about at a respectful distance.
On such occasions, should you persist in watching it, it rises on wing
and flies off. Should you not mark the spot in which the nest is, but
leave it to go in pursuit of the bird, you may search for hours before
finding it, for the path leading from the water to it is generally covered
over by the herbage. Once while approaching a spot in which I knew
a Loon to be engaged in forming her nest, I was disappointed at not
finding her at work: her keen sense of hearing had apprised her of my
purpose, and cunningly must she have slipped away, for, on finding her
absent, although I had not heard any noise, I happened to look toward
the water, and there she was, gliding off in the quiet manner usual on
such occasions.
</p>

<p>
The young of the Loon are covered at birth with a kind of black
stiff down, and in a day or two after are led to the water by their
mother. They swim and dive extremely well even at this early stage
of their existence, and after being fed by regurgitation for about a fortnight,
receive portions of fish, aquatic insects, and small reptiles, until
they are able to maintain themselves. During this period, grey feathers
appear among the down of the back and belly, and the black quill-feathers
of the wings and tail gradually elongate. They are generally
very fat, and so clumsy as to be easily caught on land, if their retreat
to the water be cut off. But should you miss your opportunity, and
the birds succeed in gaining the liquid element, into which they drop
like so many Terrapins, you will be astonished to see them as it were
run over the water with extreme celerity, leaving behind them a distinct
furrow. This power of traversing the surface of the water is
possessed not only by the young and old of this species, but by all
other kinds of swimmers, including even Gallinules and Coots. When
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
the young are well able to fly, the mother entices them to remove from
the pond or lake on which they have been bred, and leads them on wing
to the nearest part of the sea, after which she leaves them to shift for
themselves. Now and then, after this period, the end of August or beginning
of September, I have still seen the young of a brood, two or
three in number, continuing together until they were induced to travel
southward, when they generally set out singly.
</p>

<p>
Having given you a figure of a young bird, taken in October 1819
from a specimen obtained on the Ohio, I will not here trouble you with
its description, but merely state that the young undergo their first
moult in December, when they are seen singularly patched with portions
of new plumage beautifully speckled with white, on a bed of almost
uniform ash-brown. I was told, while in the State of Maine,
that if the young were caught soon after being hatched, and before
they had been in the water, they would, if thrown into it, immediately
follow a paddled canoe anywhere; but, as I have not myself made the
experiment, I cannot speak of this as a fact.
</p>

<p>
Although it has been generally asserted that Loons cannot walk
or run in an efficient manner, I feel assured that on emergency the
case is very different. An instance which occurred to my youngest
son, <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>, who accompanied me to Labrador, may here
be related. One day, when he was in pursuit of some King Ducks, a
Loon chanced to fly immediately over him within shooting distance of
his enormous double-barrelled gun. The moment was propitious, and
on firing he was glad to see the bird fall broken-winged on the bare
granitic rocks. As if perfectly aware of its danger, it immediately
rose erect on its feet, and inclining its body slightly forward, ran off,
stumbled, rose again, and getting along in this manner actually reached
the water before my son, who is by no means slow of foot. The
space traversed was fully an hundred yards, and the water to an equal
distance was not more than ankle-deep. The bird and its pursuer ran
swiftly through the water, and just as both reached a sudden break about
four feet in depth, the Loon, which had been wounded elsewhere than in
the wing, expired and floated at the disposal of its enemy, who brought
it on board the Ripley; when I entered this anecdote in my journal.
</p>

<p>
These birds are so very strong and hardy that some of the old ones
remain in Maine and Massachusetts until all the fresh waters are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
frozen, first leaving the quiet lakes and ponds, then the slow streams,
and lastly the turbulent pools below waterfalls, which latter they do
not quit until they are overhung by icicles and deserted of fish. On
the other hand, this species returns northward at a later period than
most others that breed in high latitudes. I have witnessed the arrival
of some on the coast of Labrador, after they had crossed the Gulf of
St Lawrence, as late as the 20th of June, after which they had scarcely
four months to seek out a breeding place, lay their eggs, hatch and
rear their young, and with them remove southward, before the rigour
of winter commenced.
</p>

<p>
The Great Northern Diver is a heavy-bodied bird, and generally
swims rather deep in the water, more especially if apprehensive of immediate
danger, when scarcely more than two inches in height of its
back can be seen above the surface. As its body is more flattened
than that of the Cormorant, this circumstance might seem to favour
the action in question; but other species less depressed exhibit the
same peculiarity; and I have thought that in all of these the internal
structure alone can account for this peculiar faculty.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of that most expert of all divers, the Anhinga,
and the Great Auk, the Loon is perhaps the most accomplished.
Whether it be fishing in deep water amid rolling billows, or engaged
in eluding its foes, it disappears beneath the surface so suddenly, remains
so long in the water, and rises at so extraordinary a distance, often
in a direction quite the reverse of that supposed to be followed by
it, that your eyes become wearied in searching for it, and you renounce
the wish of procuring it out of sheer vexation. At least, this has very
frequently happened to me; nay, I have at times abandoned the chase
when the bird was so severely wounded as to be obliged to dive immediately
beside my boat, and had it not died of exhaustion and floated
near enough to be seized by me, I felt as if I could not have pulled my
oars any longer, and was willing to admit that I was outdone by a
Loon.
</p>

<p>
In Labrador, where these birds were abundant, my son <span class="smcap">John</span> one
day shot at one on wing, which fell upon the water to appearance
quite dead, and remained on its back motionless until we had leisurely
rowed to it, when a sailor put out his hand to take it up. The Loon,
however, to our surprise, suddenly sprung up, and dived, and while we
stood amazed, watching its appearance, we saw it come up at the distance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
of about an hundred yards, shake its head, and disgorge a quantity
of fish mixed with blood; on which it dived again, and seemed
lost to us. We rowed however to the spot in all haste, and the moment
it rose, sent another shot after it, which terminated its career.
On examining it afterwards, we found it quite riddled by the heavy
shot.
</p>

<p>
If ever so slightly wounded, the Loon prefers diving to flying off,
and all your endeavours to kill it are almost sure to prove unavailing,
You may shoot at it under such circumstances, but you will lose both
your time and your ammunition. Its keenness of sight defies the best
percussion-locked gun, for it is generally deep in the water before the
shot reaches the spot where it has been. When fatigued with diving
in the ordinary manner, it will sink backwards, like a Grebe or a Frog,
make for some concealed spot among the rushes, and there lie until
your eyes ache with searching, and your stomach admonishes you of
the propriety of retiring.
</p>

<p>
Loons are now and then caught in fishermen’s nets, and are soon
drowned. I have also caught them with hooks fastened to lines laid
across the Ohio, but on no such occasion have I taken the bird alive. A
method of shooting these birds, which I have often practised, and which
was several times successfully employed by our Labrador party, may here
be related. On seeing a Loon on the water, at whatever distance, the
sportsman immediately places himself under the nearest cover on the
shore, and remains there as carefully concealed as possible. A few
minutes are allowed to pass, to give the wary and sharp-sighted bird
all due confidence; during which time the gun, charged with large
shot, is laid in a convenient position. The gunner then takes his cap or
pocket-handkerchief, which if brightly coloured is so much the better,
and raising it in one hand, waves it three or four times, and then suddenly
conceals it. The bird commonly detects the signal at once,
and, probably imagining the object thus exhibited to be one of its own
species, gradually advances, emitting its love-notes, which resemble a
coarse laugh, as it proceeds.  The sportsman imitates these notes,
making them loud and yet somewhat mellow, waving his cap or kerchief
at the same time, and this he continues to do at intervals. The
Loon, in order to arrive more quickly, dives, perhaps rises within
fifty yards of him, and calling less loudly, advances with considerable
caution. He shews the signal less frequently, imitates the notes of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
the bird more faintly, and carefully keeps himself concealed, until the
Loon, having approached within twenty or even ten paces, dives and
on emerging raises itself up to shake its wings, when off goes the shot,
and the deluded bird floats dead on the water. Many species of Ducks
are procured in nearly the same manner. The male Turkey, in the
gobbling season, and the Stag in autumn, may also be drawn within shot
by the same means. I once “tolled” two Loons with my hat from a
distance of nearly half a mile, and although they were at one time so
near to me that I could clearly perceive the colour of their eyes, I had
no sure opportunity of firing at them, as it was in the pairing season,
and they never once dived, or raised their wings to flap them, so that,
knowing the extreme agility with which they disappear when they have
seen a gun snap, I judged it useless to shoot. Until my visit to Labrador
I had supposed, agreeably to the common belief, that the Loons
always repose at night on the water, which, however, I have since assured
myself they rarely if ever do.
</p>

<p>
Colonel <span class="smcap">Montagu</span>, than whom none has written more correctly on the
habits of the birds of Great Britain, having procured a wounded Loon,
placed it in a pond, and observed the manner in which it made its way
under the surface of the water. “In swimming and diving,” he remarks,
“only the legs are used and not the wings, as in the Guillemot
and Auk tribes, and by their position so far behind, and their little deviation
from the line of the body, the bird is enabled to propel itself
in the water with great velocity, in a straight line, as well as turn with
astonishing quickness.” This I have no doubt was the case with the
individual observed; but that this is not the usual mode of proceeding
of the species is equally true. Having myself seen Loons pass and
repass under boats, at the distance of several feet from the surface,
and propel themselves both with their feet, and their half-extended
wings, I am inclined to believe that when not wounded, and when
pursuing their prey, they usually employ all the limbs.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, who kept one for some time, gives
the following account of its manners while in his possession. “A
young bird of this kind which I obtained in the Salt Marsh at Chelsea
Beach, and transferred to a fish-pond, made a good deal of plaint, and
would sometimes wander out of his more natural element, and hide and
bask in the grass. On these occasions he lay very still until nearly approached,
and then slid into the pond and uttered his usual plaint.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
When out at a distance he made the same cautious efforts to hide, and
would commonly defend himself in great anger, by darting at the intruder,
and striking powerfully with his dagger-like bill. This bird,
with a pink-coloured iris-like albinos, appeared to suffer from the glare
of broad day-light, and was inclined to hide from its effects, but became
very active towards the dusk of the evening. The pupil of the
eye in this individual, like that of nocturnal animals, appeared indeed
dilatable; and the one in question often put down his head and eyes
into the water to observe the situation of his prey. This bird was a
most expert and indefatigable diver, and remained down sometimes
for several minutes, often swimming under water, and as it were flying
with the velocity of an arrow in the air. Though at length inclining
to become docile, and shewing no alarm when visited, it constantly
betrayed its wandering habits, and every night was found to have
waddled to some hiding place, where it seemed to prefer hunger to
the loss of liberty, and never could be restrained from exercising its
instinct to move onwards to some secure or more suitable asylum.”
</p>

<p>
The same valued friend has corroborated the result of my observations
respecting the number of eggs usually laid by this species, by
stating as follows: “About the 11th of June, through the kindness of
Dr <span class="smcap">J. W. Harris</span>, I received three eggs, which had been taken from
the nest of a Loon, made in a hummock, or elevated grassy hillock, at
Sebago Pond, in New Hampshire.”
</p>

<p>
The range of this species is immense. It occurs on the waters
that fall into the Pacific Ocean, and has been observed on the Columbia
River. In the Fur Countries it is plentiful; and, as I have already
stated, it breeds in many parts of the United States. It is
found equally in Europe, and the northern parts of Asia. In all these
countries it moves southward on the approach of winter, and returns
when the mild weather commences in spring.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the Cormorant, the Loon usually swallows its food under
the water, unless when it happens to bring up a shell-fish or a crustaceous
animal, which it munches for a while before it swallows it.
Fishes of numerous kinds, aquatic insects, water-lizards, frogs, and
leeches, have been found by me in its stomach, in which there is
also generally much coarse gravel, and sometimes the roots of fresh-water
plants.
</p>

<p>
Although the flesh of the Loon is not very palatable, being tough,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
rank, and dark coloured, I have seen it much relished by many lovers
of good-living, especially at Boston, where it was not unfrequently
served almost raw at the table of the house where I boarded.
</p>

<p>
A female bird particularly examined by me presented the following
appearances. From the point of the bill to the end of the tail it measured
34 inches; to the claws 41; the extended wings were 71; the bill
measured 5 inches along the gape; the breadth of the body was 8
inches, its depth only four; the wings were 2 inches shorter than the
tail; and the weight was 10 lb. 11 oz. avoirdupois. The first primary
was longest. The trachea, which was even and flattened, being in
diameter about <span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span> of an inch by <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> inch, was 16 inches long. The eggs
were numerous. The gizzard was moderate, and contained many large
pebbles. The intestines were 7 feet long, and about the same size as
a Swan’s quill. Every bone and sinew was strong and tough. The
tongue resembled in shape and size that of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker.
The bones of the wing and leg were almost solid, the cavity
for the marrow being very small. All the bones of this specimen
were presented to Mr <span class="smcap">Thomas Allis</span>, of the Friend’s Retreat, near
York.
</p>

<p>
My friend Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span>, of the Royal Navy of
England, once placed at my disposal a specimen of the Loon procured
in a very high latitude, and which, having closely inspected it, I found
to differ from the one represented in the plate, only in having the
point of the bill slightly elevated or recurved, and of a fine yellow
tint. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informed me that, on one of his arduous northern
journeys, he saw a very large and handsomely crested Diver, which,
although somewhat prematurely, I propose honouring with the name
of <i>Colymbus Richardsoni</i>.

Bill pale yellowish-green, the ridge and tip of the upper mandible
dusky. Iris brown. Feet dusky externally, pale yellowish flesh-colour

A fine male killed at Boston, 34 inches in length, with an alar extent
of 56, presents the following characters. There is a general layer
of subcutaneous adipose tissue, and the skin is very tenacious. The
external aperture of the ear roundish, very small, having a diameter
of only 2 lines. The tongue is 2 inches 1 line in length, fleshy, as
high as broad, slightly concave and longitudinally grooved above, tapering
to a horny point. On the palate are 6 rows of papillæ; the
posterior aperture of the nares is linear <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches in length. The
aperture of the glottis is <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> an inch long, with numerous papillæ along its
sides and behind. The pharynx is extremely dilatable, as is the
œsophagus, which is 17 inches long, passes along the right side of the
neck, together with the trachea, and when distended has an average
diameter of <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches, but on entering the thorax contracts to <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>.
The structure of the œsophagus in birds may be very conveniently
examined in this species, the different layers being remarkably developed
in it. Properly speaking, it has only two coats,—the outer muscular,
its external layer composed of transverse or circular fibres, the
internal of equally distinct longitudinal fibres, which are not straight,
but irregularly undulated. The inner, or mucous coat, when contracted
falls into longitudinal plaits. The proventriculus is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches
long, the glandules large, roundish, simple, and disposed in a continuous
belt. Over this part, the transverse muscular fibres are remarkably
developed. The right lobe of the liver is <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches long, the
left lobe <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>. The heart is very large, of a broadly conical form, 3

inches long, <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches in breadth. The stomach is three inches long,
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> in breadth, of an elliptical form, a little compressed; its lateral
muscles 9 lines in thickness, and composed of strong large fasciculi;
the tendons <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch in diameter; the cuticular lining thick, its upper
and lower parts marked with strong longitudinal ridges having
numerous transverse fissures; the grinding surfaces irregularly wrinkled,
with a deep fissure down the middle of each. The pylorus is 8 lines
in diameter when distended, and is destitute of valve, but has a
strong prominent rim. In the stomach were remains of fishes, and
some pebbles, chiefly quartz, the largest 4 lines long. The intestine
measures 6 feet 6 inches in length, and varies in diameter from 8
to 6 lines. The rectum is <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, the cloaca extremely large,
forming a cavity about 3 inches in diameter. The cæca are <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch
long, cylindrical, rounded at the extremity; one of them 7 lines, the
other 9 lines, in diameter.

<p>
The trachea, when moderately extended, measures <span class="mixfract">13&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches in
length, inconsiderably depressed, its transverse diameter at the upper
part <span class="mixfract">9&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> lines, at the lower <span class="mixfract">6&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> lines; the rings cartilaginous, of moderate
breadth, uniform, with a contraction in the middle before and
behind, their number 134, the four lowest united. The bronchi are
composed of about 20 narrow cartilaginous half rings. The contractor
muscles are very broad but thin, their fibres irregularly disposed in
front; they become thicker and narrower toward the lower part, and
are continued beyond the sterno-tracheal muscles, which come off
from the 20th ring from the inferior larynx, to the membrane between
the last tracheal and first bronchial ring.

<h2>
BLUE HERON.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea cœrulea</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCVII. Adult Male and Young</span>.
</p>


<p>
Along with a few other Herons, this is, comparatively speaking,
confined within narrow limits along our southern coast in winter. It
occurs, however, in most parts of the Floridas, where it is a constant
resident, and whence, at the approach of summer, vast multitudes are
seen proceeding northward, in search of suitable places in which
they may rear their young in security. Many, however, go southward,
beyond the limits of the United States, and proceed coastwise
to Texas and Mexico to spend the winter, especially the younger
birds, when still in that singular white plumage which differs so much
from that of the young of every other known species of this genus,
except that of the Reddish Egret (<i>A. rufescens</i>). At New Orleans,
where it arrives at the same period, both from Mexico and the Floridas,
its first appearance in spring is about the beginning of March;
at which time also multitudes leave the Floridas on their way eastward,
to settle in Georgia, the Carolinas, and other States farther
east, as far as Long Island in that of New York. Beyond this, I
believe, no birds of the species have been met with. They rarely, if
ever, proceed far inland, or leave the shores of our large rivers and
estuaries. On the Mississippi, the swamps and lakes on the borders
of which are so well adapted to the habits of these birds, few individuals
are ever seen above Natchez. About the beginning of September,
by which time the young are able to shift for themselves, they
return southward.
</p>

<p>
When in the Floridas, during winter, I observed that the Blue
Herons associated with other species, particularly the White Heron,
<i>Ardea alba</i>, and the Louisiana Heron, <i>Ardea Ludoviciana</i>, all of which
were in the habit of roosting together in the thick evergreen low
bushes that cover the central parts of the islands along the coast.
Their passage to and from their feeding places, is as regular as the
rising and setting of the sun, and, unless frequently disturbed, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
betake themselves every night to the same locality, and almost to the
same spot. In the morning, they rise with one accord from the roosts
on which they have been standing all night on one leg, the other
drawn up among the feathers of the abdomen, their neck retracted,
and their head and bill buried beneath their scapulars. On emerging
from their retreats, they at once proceed to some distant place in
search of food, and spend the day principally on the head waters of
the rivers, and the fresh-water lakes of the interior, giving a decided
preference to the soft mud banks, where small crabs or fiddlers are
abundant, on which they feed greedily, when the inland ponds have
been dried up, and consequently no longer supply them with such
fishes as they are wont to feed upon.
</p>

<p>
There, and at this season, Reader, you may see this graceful Heron,
quietly and in silence walking along the margins of the water, with an
elegance and grace which can never fail to please you. Each regularly-timed
step is lightly measured, while the keen eye of the bird seeks
for and watches the equally cautious movements of the objects towards
which it advances with all imaginable care. When at a proper distance,
it darts forth its bill with astonishing celerity, to pierce and secure
its prey; and this it does with so much precision, that, while
watching some at a distance with a glass, I rarely observed an instance
of failure. If fish is plentiful, on the shallows near the shore, when it
has caught one, it immediately swallows it, and runs briskly through
the water, striking here and there, and thus capturing several in succession.
Two or three dashes of this sort, afford sufficient nourishment
for several hours, and when the bird has obtained enough it retires
to some quiet place, and remains there in an attitude of repose
until its hunger returns. During this period of rest, however, it is as
watchful as ever, and on hearing the least noise, or perceiving the slightest
appearance of danger, spreads its wings, and flies off to some other
place, sometimes to a very distant one. About an hour before sunset,
they are again seen anxiously searching for food. When at length satisfied,
they rise simultaneously from all parts of the marsh, or shore,
arrange themselves into loose bodies, and ascending to the height of
fifty or sixty yards in the air, fly in a straight course towards their
roosting place. I saw very few of these birds during the winter, on
or near the river St John in Florida; but on several occasions met
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
with some on small ponds in the pine barrens, at a considerable distance
from any large stream, whither they had been attracted by the
great number of frogs.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Blue Heron is rather swifter than that of the Egret,
<i>Ardea candidissima</i>, and considerably more so than that of the Great Blue
Heron, <i>Ardea Herodias</i>, but very similar to that of the Louisiana Heron,
<i>Ardea Ludoviciana</i>. When the bird is travelling, the motion is performed
by flappings in quick succession, which rapidly propel it in a direct
line, until it is about to alight, when it descends in circular sailings of
considerable extent towards the spot selected. During strong adverse
winds, they fly low, and in a continuous line, passing at the necessary
distance from the shores to avoid danger, whether at an early or a late
hour of the day. I recollect that once, on such an occasion, when, on
the 15th of March, I was in company with my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, I
saw a large flock about sunset arising from across the river, and circling
over a large pond, eight miles distant from Charleston. So cautious
were they, that although the flock was composed of several hundred individuals,
we could not manage to get so much as a chance of killing
one. I have been surprised to see how soon the Blue Herons become
shy after reaching the districts to which they remove for the purpose
of breeding from their great rendezvous the Floridas, where I never
experienced any difficulty in procuring as many as I wished. In Louisiana,
on the other hand, I have found them equally vigilant on their
first arrival. On several occasions, when I had placed myself under
cover, to shoot at some, while on their way to their roosts or to their
feeding grounds, I found it necessary to shift from one place to another,
for if one of them had been fired at and had fallen in a particular
place, all that were in its company took care not to pass again near it,
but when coming up diverged several hundred yards, and increased
their speed until past, when they would assume their more leisurely
flappings. In South Carolina, where they are very shy on their arrival,
I have seen them fly off on hearing the very distant report of a gun,
and alight on the tops of the tallest trees, where they would congregate
in hundreds, and whence they would again fly off on the least apprehension
of danger. But when once these Herons have chosen a place
to nestle in, or reached one in which they bred the preceding year,
they become so tame as to allow you to shoot as many as you are disposed
to have.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
</p>

<p>
While on Cayo Island, in the Gulf of Mexico, on the 10th of April
1837, I observed large flocks of the Blue and Green Herons, <i>Ardea
cœrulea</i> and <i>A. virescens</i>, arriving from the westward about the middle
of the day. They flew at a considerable height, and came down like
so many hawks, to alight on the low bushes growing around the sequestered
ponds; and this without any other noise than the rustling
of their wings as they glided through the air towards the spot on which
they at once alighted. There they remained until sunset, when they
all flew off, so that none were seen there next day. This shews that
although these species migrate both by day and night, they are quite
diurnal during the period of their residence in any section of the country
which they may have chosen for a season. It is more than probable
that it has been from want of personal knowledge of the habits
of these birds, that authors have asserted that all Herons are nocturnally
inclined. This certainly is by no means the case, although they
find it advantageous to travel by night during their migrations, which
is a remarkable circumstance as opposed to their ordinary habits. In
the instance above mentioned, I found the birds remarkably gentle,
which was probably owing to fatigue.
</p>

<p>
The Blue Heron breeds earlier or later according to the temperature
of the district to which it resorts for that purpose, and therefore
earlier in Florida, where, however, considerable numbers remain, during
the whole year than in other parts of the United States. Thus I have
found them in the southern parts of that country, sitting on their eggs,
on the 1st of March, fully a month earlier than in the vicinity of
Bayou Sara, on the Mississippi, where they are as much in advance of
those which betake themselves, in very small numbers indeed, to our
Middle Districts, in which they rarely begin to breed before the fifteenth
of May.
</p>

<p>
The situations which they choose for their nests are exceedingly
varied. I have found them sitting on their eggs on the Florida Keys,
and on the islands in the Bay of Galveston, in Texas, in nests placed
amidst and upon the most tangled cactuses, so abundant on those curious
isles, on the latter of which the climbing Rattlesnake often
gorges itself with the eggs of this and other species of Heron, as well
as with their unfledged young. In the Lower parts of Louisiana, it
breeds on low bushes of the water-willow, as it also does in South
Carolina; whereas, on the islands on the coast of New Jersey, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
even on the mainland of that State, it places its nest on the branches
of the cedar and other suitable trees. Wherever you find its breeding
place, you may expect to see other birds in company with it, for like
all other species, excepting perhaps the Louisiana Heron, it rarely objects
to admit into its society the Night Heron, the Yellow-crowned
Heron, or the White Egret.
</p>

<p>
The heronries of the southern portions of the United States are
often of such extraordinary size as to astonish the passing traveller.
I confess that I myself might have been as sceptical on this point as
some who, having been accustomed to find in all places the Heron to
be a solitary bird, cannot be prevailed on to believe the contrary, had
I not seen with my own eyes the vast multitudes of individuals of different
species breeding together in peace in certain favourable localities.
Such persons may be excused from giving that credit to my account
of the Passenger Pigeon which posterity will, I trust, accord
to it.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Blue Heron, wherever situated, is loosely formed
of dry sticks, sometimes intermixed with green leaves of various trees,
and with grass or moss, according as these materials happen to be
plentiful in the neighbourhood. It is nearly flat, and can scarcely be
said to have a regular lining. Sometimes you see a solitary nest fixed
on a cactus, a bush, or a tree; but a little beyond this you may observe
from six to ten, placed almost as closely together as you would have put
them had you measured out the space necessary for containing them.
Some are seen low over the water, while others are placed high; for,
like the rest of its tribe, this species is rather fond of placing its tenement
over or near the liquid element.
</p>

<p>
The eggs are usually three, rarely four; and I have never found a nest
of this species containing five eggs, as is stated by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, who, probably
found a nest of the Green Heron containing that number among
others of the present species. They measure an inch and three quarters
in length, by an inch and a quarter in breadth, being about the
size of those of <i>Ardea candidissima</i>, though rather more elongated, and
precisely of the same colour.
</p>

<p>
The young bird is at first almost destitute of feathers, but scantily
covered with yellowish-white down. When fully fledged, its bill
and legs are greenish-black, and its plumage pure white, or slightly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
tinged with cream-colour, the tips of the three outer primaries light
greyish-blue. Of this colour the bird remains until the breeding season,
when, however, some individuals exhibit a few straggling pale
blue feathers. When they have entered on their second year, these
young birds become spotted with deeper blue on some parts of the
body, or on the head and neck, thus appearing singularly patched with
that colour and pure white, the former increasing with the age of the
bird in so remarkable a manner, that you may see specimens of these
birds with portions even of the pendant feathers of their head or shoulders
so marked. And these are produced by <i>full moultings</i>, by which
I mean the unexpected appearance, as it were, of feathers growing out
of the skin of the bird coloured entirely blue, as is the case in many of
our land birds. In all these stages of plumage, and from the first spring
after birth, the young birds breed with others, as is equally the case
with <i>Ardea rufescens</i>. You may see a pure white individual paired
with one of a full blue colour, or with one patched with blue and white.
The young, after leaving their parents, remain separate from the old
birds until the next breeding season. At no period can the young of
this species be confounded with, or mistaken for that of the <i>Ardea candidissima</i>,
by a person really acquainted with these birds, for the Blue
Heron is not only larger than the latter, but the very colour of its feet
and legs is perfectly distinctive. Indeed, during the time when the
young Blue Heron is quite white (excepting on the tips of the outer
primaries), it would be easier to confound it with the young of the
Reddish Egret, <i>Ardea rufescens</i>, than with that of any other, were the
feathers of its hind head and neck of the same curious curled appearance
as those of that species.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> informs me, that in South Carolina, this
species not unfrequently breeds in the company of the Louisiana Heron,
the nests and eggs of which, he adds, are very similar. He has
specimens of these birds in all the different stages which I have described.
At New Orleans, the Blue Herons, during the transition of
their plumage from white to blue, are called “Egrettes folles,” or
foolish Egrets, on account of their unusual tameness. My friend
<span class="smcap">Bachman</span> and I, shot, on the 6th and 9th of April, several specimens
spotted with blue feathers, and having their crests and trains similarly
mixed, although of full length; but in most of the specimens obtained,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
the white was still prevalent. I have shot some in Louisiana, in autumn,
in the same curious dress.
</p>

<p>
This species, though larger than the Snowy Heron, <i>Ardea candidissima</i>,
is considerably inferior to it in courage; and I was much amused
as well as surprised, when at Galveston Bay, on the 24th of April
1837, to see one of that species alight near a Purple Heron, attack it,
and pursue it as far as I could follow them with my eyes. When the
Blue Herons are on the sea-coast they not unfrequently repose on the
large mud or sand bars, at some distance from the adjacent marshes;
but they generally prefer roosting on trees or bushes, when there are
any in their neighbourhood. The Creoles of Louisiana not unfrequently
eat the flesh of this species, and although they by no means consider it
equal to that of the Night Heron, some of them have assured me that
it is not bad food. Like other birds of this family, they become larger
with age, and the male is usually somewhat superior in size to the
female; but, with this exception, no difference can be perceived in the
external appearance of the sexes.

</p>

<p>
The female is similar to the male, but smaller. Weight 11 oz.
</p>

<p>
The young are at first sparely covered with yellowish-white down.
When a fortnight old, the bill is yellow, with the tips greenish-black;
the feet greenish-yellow, the claws dusky, with the tips greyish-yellow.
The general colour of the plumage is pure white, but the down which
tips the feathers of the head is brownish-white; two of the alular feathers
are tinged with dull bluish-grey, and the outer seven or eight primaries
are broadly margined on both sides to the length of about an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
inch and a half with the same colour of a deeper tint, the extreme tip
white.
</p>

<p>
When fully fledged, the bare parts at the base of the bill, and the
basal half of the upper mandible, are light greenish-blue, the rest black;
the lower mandible yellow, with a patch of black, an inch and a quarter
in length on each side at the end. Legs, tarsi, and toes greenish-blue,
the sides yellowish; claws dusky. The feathers of the head are
slightly elongated; those of the back are also elongated, but much
broader and shorter than in the adult. The feathers on the upper
part of the head are of a faint bluish-grey; and the alular feathers
and eight outer primaries are tinged with the same colour. At
this period, the length to the end of the tail is 22 inches, to end of
claws <span class="mixfract">28&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>; bill along the ridge <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span>; wing from flexure 11; tail <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>.
</p>

<p>
In November, when the moult is advanced. The bill is black,
dull blue at the base. The feet are nearly black, as are the claws.
The occipital feathers are now two inches and a half in length, and
some of the dorsal feathers extend as far as the tips of the wings; those
of the lower part of the neck have also a length of about three inches.
The general colour of the plumage is white; the upper part of the
head, the hind neck, back, anterior edge of the wing, and outer primaries
at the end, of a faint bluish-grey tint; some of the elongated
feathers of the back darker.

A year old. Bill nearly as in the adult; feet bluish-black, the
plumage is white, with the upper parts pale greyish-blue as in November,
but the whole interspersed with numerous feathers of a deep
greyish-blue, similar to that of the adult; the primaries and tail being
still white.

</p>

<p>
At the age of a year the bird propagates, so that individuals in
the white, mottled, or blue plumage, may be seen breeding together.
</p>

<p>
When only a few weeks old, the serrature of the claw of the middle
toe is scarcely perceptible, exhibiting merely faint indications of
points upon a very slight margin. This margin enlarges, and when
the bird is completely fledged the serratures are perfectly formed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In this bird, as in most other Herons, the crura of the lower
mandible are thin, flexible, and elastic, the angle filled by an elastic
membrane covered by the skin. The tongue is 1 inch long, sagittate
at the base, tapering to a point. The roof of the mouth has a median
prominent ridge, and two lateral lines; the palate is convex; the posterior
aperture of the nares 10 lines in length. The pharynx may be
dilated to <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch; the œsophagus, which is 12 inches long, is when
dilated 10 lines in diameter at its upper part, and gradually contracts
to 7 lines; at the curvature of the neck it lies directly behind, having
passed down on the left side, along with the trachea. Its walls are
extremely thin, contrasting in this respect with the œsophagus of the
Great Northern Diver and other swimming piscivorous birds. The
proventriculus is 1 inch long, its glandules cylindrical, and extremely
slender. The stomach seems as if it merely formed a basal sac to
the œsophagus, its muscles being extremely thin, its tendons circular
and half an inch in diameter; cuticular lining soft. The intestine
is long and very narrow, 5 feet 10 inches in length, 2 lines in
diameter at the upper part, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> near the rectum, which is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches
long, with a diameter of <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> lines, and terminates in a nipple-like cœcum,
projecting 3 lines beyond the entrance of the small intestine, but
having no appearance of the two lateral appendages usually called
cœca. In this respect, the Blue Heron agrees with others of the
same family. The cloaca is about an inch in length and breadth.
</p>

<p>
The trachea, when extended, is <span class="mixfract">8&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches long. The rings 170
in number, are osseous and circular, so that the organ preserves its
cylindrical form under all circumstances. They are, like those of all
Herons, of equal breadth on both sides, not broad on one side
and narrow on the other, as has been represented. The contractor
muscles are very slender, as are the sterno-tracheal; the former send
down a slip on each side to the first bronchial ring. The diameter
of the trachea is 2 lines at the upper part, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> at the lower. The
bronchi are short, wide, conical, of about 13 half rings.
</p>

<p>
The right lobe of the liver is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches long, the left lobe <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>; the
heart <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> in length, 8 lines broad, of an oblong conical form. The stomach
contained remains of insects and crustaceous animals, together
with a few seeds.

TELL-TALE GODWIT.

<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCVIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
It is my opinion that they who have given so much importance to
the cry of this bird, as to believe it to be mainly instrumental in ensuring
the safety of other species, and in particular of Ducks, have
called in the aid of their imagination to increase the interest of what
requires no such illustration. A person unacquainted with this Godwit
would believe, on reading its history as recorded in books, that
the safety of these birds depends on the friendly warning of their long-billed
and long-tongued neighbour. And yet it is at no season more
noisy or more vigilant than the Kildeer Plover, nor ever half so much
so as the Semipalmated species, the reiterated vociferations of which
are so annoying. It is true that the Tell-tale is quite loquacious
enough; nay, you, Reader, and I, may admit that it is a cunning and
watchful bird, ever willing to admonish you or me, or any other person
whom it may observe advancing towards it with no good intent,
that it has all along watched us. But then, when one has observed
the habits of this bird for a considerable time, in different situations,
and when no other feathered creatures are in sight, he will be convinced
that the Tell-tale merely intends by its cries to preserve itself,
and not generously to warn others of their danger. So you may safely
banish from your mind the apprehension, which the reading of books
may have caused, that duck-shooting in the marshes of our Middle
Districts, is as hopeless a pursuit as “a wild goose chase.”
</p>

<p>
The Tell-tale Godwit has a great range in the United States,
where, indeed, I have found it in almost every district, and at all seasons.
It spends the winter along the shores of our estuaries, rivers,
and ponds, and in the rice-fields, from Maryland to Mexico. It is
abundant then in South Carolina, the Floridas, and along the shores
of the Gulf of Mexico, as far as Texas, where I found it in considerable
numbers and paired, in the months of April and May, along with
the Yellow-shank Snipe, <i>Totanus flavipes</i>. It is also met with in
spring and autumn over the whole interior of the country, and I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
found it quite abundant at those seasons along the entire length of
the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri rivers, as well as on the Arkansas.
They congregate in great numbers in the inland marshes of Florida,
and along its rivers, during the winter. I found them near Eastport,
in the State of Maine, on the 11th of May 1833; and on the coast
of Labrador, on the 18th of June of the same year. In Newfoundland,
on the 11th of August, the young were equal in size to their
parents, and being extremely fat, tender, and juicy, afforded excellent
eating. In general, however, these birds are thin and have a fishy taste.
</p>

<p>
In the State of Maine and the province of New Brunswick, the
Tell-tale is known by the name of “Humility,” which, however, is an
appellation that ill accords with its vociferous habits. The Creoles
of New Orleans call it “Clou-clou;” and were these syllables rapidly
enunciated from two to five times in succession, the sounds
would have some resemblance to the usual notes of the species.
</p>

<p>
When these Godwits arrive in the vicinity of New Orleans about
the middle of March, they appear in considerable flocks. They retire,
however, in the beginning of May, and return about the first of July,
from which time they continue there until the end of autumn, some
indeed remaining all winter. It seems, that at the period of their
disappearance at New Orleans, they retire to the vast marshes near
the sea-shore, and there breed, for I have found them abundant near
the passes or mouths of the Mississippi in pairs, on the first of April,
when the air is warmer than in the interior. They are said to breed
in the marshes along the coast of New Jersey, where, according to
Wilson, they arrive early in April, and continue until November. It
is a curious fact that the Tell-tale Godwit, as well as some other birds
of similar habits, is of very rare occurrence along the shores of Massachusetts
and Maine. This, however, seems to be accounted for by
the absence there of the large spongy marshes, to which these birds
are fond of resorting.
</p>

<p>
Although found in the vicinity of both salt and fresh water, at all
seasons, it usually prefers the latter, and the spots which appear to be
best adapted to its nature are ponds of which the water is shallow
and the shores muddy, so that they can walk and wade at ease upon
them. Wherever such ponds occur, whether in plantations or in the
interior of forests, or on extensive savannahs or prairies, there you
will find them actively employed, wading so far into the water as to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
seem as if they were swimming. If just alighted after ever so short
a flight, they hold their wings upright for a considerable time, as if
doubtful of not having obtained good footing. Closing their wings,
they then move nimbly about the pool, and are seen catching small
fishes, insects, worms, or snails, which they do with rapidity and a
considerable degree of grace, for their steps are light, and the
balancing or vibratory motion of their body, while their head is gently
moved backwards and forwards, is very pleasing to the eye.
</p>

<p>
I have often observed these birds on large logs floating on the
Mississippi, and moving gently with the current, and this sometimes
in company with the Snowy Heron, <i>Ardea candidissima</i>, or the American
Crow, <i>Corvus Americanus</i>. In such situations, they procure
shrimps and the fry of fishes. In autumn, they are extremely prone
to betake themselves to the margins of our most sequestered lakes in
the interior of Louisiana and Kentucky, where the summer heat has
left exposed great flats of soft sandy mud abounding with food suited
to their appetite, and where they are much less likely to be disturbed
than when on the marshes on the sea-shore, or on the margins of rivers.
When they have been some time in the salt-marshes, and have
eaten indiscriminately small shell-fish, worms, and fry, they acquire a
disagreeable fishy taste, and being at the same time less fat, are
scarcely fit for the table. They are social birds, and frequently mingle
with other waders, as well as with the smaller ducks, such as the
Blue-winged and Green-winged Teals. In the salt-marshes they associate
with Curlews, Willets, and other species, with which they live in
peace, and on the watchfulness of which they depend quite as much as
on their own.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Tell-tale Godwit, or “Great Yellow-Shank,” as
it is generally named in the Western Country, is swift, at times
elevated, and, when necessary, sustained. They pass through the air with
their necks and legs stretched to their full length, and roam over the
places which they select several times before they alight, emitting
their well-known and easily imitated whistling notes, should any suspicious
object be in sight, or if they are anxious to receive the answer
of some of their own tribe that have already alighted. At such
times, any person who can imitate their cries can easily check their
flight, and in a few moments induce them to pass or to alight within
shooting distance. This I have not unfrequently succeeded in doing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
when they were, at the commencement of my calls, almost half a mile
distant. Nay, I have sometimes seen them so gentle, that on my
killing several in a flock, the rest would only remove a few yards.
</p>

<p>
I have always found that the cries of this bird were louder and
more frequent during the period of its breeding, when scarcely any
birds were in the vicinity. I therefore conclude that its cries are then
more intended to draw you from the spot where its nest is concealed,
than for any other purpose, as on such occasions the bird either moves
off on foot, or flies away and alights at a short distance from the place
where its treasure lies.
</p>

<p>
When in Labrador, I found these birds breeding, two or three
pairs together, in the delightful quiet valleys bounded by rugged hills
of considerable height, and watered by limpid brooks. These valleys
exhibit, in June and July, the richest verdure, luxuriant grasses
of various species growing here and there in separate beds many yards
in extent, while the intervening spaces, which are comparatively bare,
are of that boggy nature so congenial to the habits of these species.
In one of those pleasing retreats my son found a pair of Tell-tales, in
the month of June, both of which were procured. The female was
found to contain a full-formed egg, and some more of the size of peas.
The eggs are four, pyriform, <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches long, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup"><span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span></span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> in their greatest
breadth, pale greenish-yellow, marked with blotches of umber and pale
purplish-grey.
</p>

<p>
The plumage of this bird has a very different appearance in autumn
and winter from that which it presents at the approach of the breeding
season. This has led some students of Nature in the United States
to suppose, that there exist two nearly allied species; but this, I am
confident, is not the case. The female is larger than the male, but
only in a slight degree.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> has found this species on the Saskatchewan and
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> on the Columbia River.

<h2>
COMMON TERN.
</h2>

</p>


<p>
Although the Prince of Musignano has thought that the bird
named the Common Tern in America, differs from that bearing the
same name in Europe, and has in consequence changed its appellation
to that of Wilson’s Tern, I am of opinion that no difference exists
between the Common Terns of the two Continents. The cry of both
is besides precisely similar, so that with me there is no doubt whatever
as to their identity. Experience has shewn me that the markings
or white spots on the primary quills of Gulls, at one time assumed
as a criterion by which species might be distinguished, cannot in the
least be depended on, varying, as they always do, in individuals of
the same species, at almost each successive moult. Then why, Reader,
should not Terns exhibit analogous changes? The fact is, they do so;
and it is almost impossible, on closely inspecting a dozen or more
specimens procured at the same period, in either country, to find two
individuals exactly corresponding in every particular. Some have the
bill almost entirely black, while others have it more or less red and
black, and tipped with yellow. The length of the tail-feathers, that of
the tarsus, and the size of the inter-digital membranes, are all found
to differ in some degree, if minutely compared. If species are to be
founded on such slight differences, an ample field is open to those
who are ambitious of being discoverers. At all events, I cannot help
remarking here, that it seems to me improper to impose new names
on objects, until it is proved by undeniable facts that they present
permanent differences.
</p>

<p>
I have observed this species along the Atlantic coast of North
America, from Galveston Island in Texas to the Straits of Belle Isle
on the coast of Labrador, both in spring and in early autumn. But
when on the islands in Galveston Bay, in the month of April, I saw
only a few arriving there from the west; whereas, in the beginning of
May great numbers arrived there from the east, settled at once, and
commenced breeding. I felt convinced that the numbers which came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
from the direction of the Floridas were much greater than those which
arrived from the westward, and judged it probable that vast numbers
had at the same time left the Peninsula on their way northward.
Should other travellers observe the same or similar phenomena at the
season mentioned, it will be proved that this species does not extend
its autumnal migration so far as several others, which I observed arriving
at Galveston Island from the south-west, for example, the Least
Tern, <i>Sterna minuta</i>, the Cayenne Tern, <i>St. cayana</i>, and the Black
Tern, <i>St. nigra</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Common Tern commences breeding on the coast of our Middle
Districts about the 5th of May. On my voyage to Labrador, I found
its eggs on the islands in the Gulf of St Lawrence, and especially on
the Magdalene Islands, which I visited on the 11th of that month.
On the 18th I saw them in great abundance in the neighbourhood of
American Harbour, on the coast of Labrador, where thousands of
Terns were plunging headlong after shrimps all round us. In that
country, their eggs were deposited among the short grass, and the
places which they occupied were but slightly scratched; whereas on
the Magdalene Islands, where they breed on sandy ridges, slight hollows
were scooped out, as is generally the case along the eastern coast
of the United States. Their sojourn in Labrador is of short duration;
and when we were at Newfoundland, on the 14th of August,
multitudes were already passing southward. At the same period considerable
numbers pass by an inland route from the Canadas, and all
our great lakes, travelling along the Ohio and Mississippi. While residing
at Henderson, and afterwards at Cincinnati, I had ample opportunities
of watching their movements in the month of September.
And yet, you will think it strange, that, during their vernal migration,
I never saw one ascend any of these rivers or the streams connected
with them. Perhaps the inferior temperature of the waters, compared
with those of the ocean, in the early spring months, may induce them
to abandon their route at that season. In autumn, on the contrary,
when these rivers are heated and reduced in size, the Terns may find
in them an abundant supply of the fry of various fishes. It would
thus appear, being corroborated by other observations which I have
made relative to migration, that species whose range is extensive, are
determined in their movements by a genial temperature and an abundant
supply of food.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
</p>

<p>
With an easy and buoyant flight, the Tern visits the whole of our
indented coasts, with the intention of procuring food, or of rearing its
young, amidst all the comforts and enjoyments which kind Nature has
provided for it. Full of agreeable sensations, the mated pair glide
along side by side, as gaily as ever glided bridegroom and bride. The
air is warm, the sky of the purest azure, and in every nook the glittering
fry tempts them to satiate their appetite. Here, dancing in
the sunshine, with noisy mirth, the vast congregation spreads over the
sandy shores, where, from immemorial time, the species has taken up
its temporary abode. They all alight, and with minced steps, and
tails carefully raised so as not to be injured by the sand, the different
pairs move about, renew their caresses, and scoop out a little cavity in
the soil. If you come again in a few days, you will find the place covered
with eggs. There they lie, three in each hollow, beautifully
spotted and pointed; and as they receive heat enough from the sun,
the birds have left them until evening. But not absent are they from
the cherished spot, for they have seen you, and now they all fly up
screaming. Although unable to drive you away, they seem most anxiously
to urge your departure by every entreaty they can devise;
just as you would do, were your family endangered by some creature
as much stronger than yourself as you are superior to them. Humanity
fills your heart, you feel for them as a parent feels, and you willingly
abandon the place. The eggs are soon hatched; the young in due
time follow their parents, who, not considering their pleasant labour
ended when they are able to fly, feed them on wing in the manner of
swallows, until they are quite capable of procuring their subsistence
themselves. So soon as this is the case, the young birds fly off in bands,
to seek on distant shores, and in sunny climes, the plentiful food which
the ocean yields.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Common Tern is, as I have said, a mere hollow
made in the loose sand of some island or mainland beach, scantily
tufted with wiry grass, or strewed with sea-weeds. Their eggs never
exceed three in number; their average length is 1 inch <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> eighths,
their breadth <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch. They vary greatly in their markings, as is the
case with those of all the smaller species of this family; but their
ground colour is generally pale yellowish-green, blotched and spotted
with brownish-black and purplish-grey or neutral tint.
</p>

<p>
The young, which are fed with small fishes, shrimps, and insects,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
separate from the old birds when fully fledged, and do not again associate
with them until the following spring, when both are found breeding
in the same places. It seems quite curious to see these young birds
in winter, during boisterous weather, throwing themselves into the
remotest parts of estuaries, and even visiting salt-water ponds at some
distance from the sea, as I have often seen them do at Charleston,
in South Carolina, when accompanied by my friend the Rev. Dr
<span class="smcap">Bachman</span>. Their plumage is then so very different from that of the
old birds, that one might readily believe them to be of another species,
did he not observe that their mode of flying and their notes
are the same. Not less strange is it, that on such occasions none of
the old birds are to be seen in the place, they having remained,
braving the fury of the tempest, on the outer harbours. In the beginning
of winter, young birds also sometimes ascend the Mississippi
as far as Natchez; and in the same manner betake themselves to all
the large lakes bordering the Gulf of Mexico. There, as well as elsewhere,
you see them plunge into the water, and instantaneously secure
their prey, rise as quickly, and dash into another spot hard by, whenever
food happens to be abundant.
</p>

<p>
I have many times seen the Common Tern suddenly fly up and
come close over a man or a dog, without the least apparent provocation,
indeed when far distant from its nest, and then pass and repass
repeatedly within a few yards, emitting a plaintive cry, as if its eggs
or young were in the immediate vicinity. At other times, when the
birds were yet distant from their young, and carrying fish in their bills,
they would, on seeing a man, round to, drop their food, and perform
the same evolutions. I, however, know nothing more remarkable of
this species of Tern, than that it should breed, as I know from personal
observation to be the case, along the whole of our Atlantic coast,
in suitable places, from Texas to Labrador.
</p>

<p>
When travelling in stormy weather, they skim over the surface of
the water, moving rapidly and close together; whereas in fine weather,
they rise high, and proceed in a straggling manner. Now and then I
have seen them alight among Tringas of different species, as well as
among Razor-billed Shearwaters, on outward sand beaches.

SPOTTED SANDPIPER.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Totanus macularius</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
In the course of my last journey in search of information respecting
the birds which at one season or other are found within the limits
of the United States, I observed so vast a number of them in Texas,
that I almost concluded that more than two-thirds of our species occur
there. Among them I observed the beautiful bird now before you.
</p>

<p>
The Spotted Sandpiper has a wonderfully extensive range, for I
have met with it not only in most parts of the United States, but also on
the shores of Labrador, where, on the 17th June 1833, I found it breeding.
On the 29th of July, the young were fully fledged, and scampering
over the rocks about us, amid the putrid and drying cod-fish. In
that country it breeds later by three months than in Texas; for on
the head waters of Buffalo Bayou, about sixty miles from the margin
of the Mexican Gulf, I saw broods already well grown on the 5th of
May 1837. On the same day of the same month in 1832, a similar occurrence
happened on an island near Indian Key, on the south-east coast
of Florida. In Newfoundland, on the other hand, the young were just
fully fledged on the 11th of August 1833. It appears strange that
none were observed by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> on the shores of Hudson’s Bay,
or in the interior of that country. They are quite abundant along the
margins of the Mississippi, the Ohio, and their tributaries, where they
remain until driven off by the cold, and return about the beginning of
April, at which period the Purple Martin also makes its appearance.
In our Middle Districts, they arrive a fortnight later. On the Island
of Jestico, in the Gulf of St Lawrence, about twenty pairs had nests
and eggs on the 11th of June; and the air was filled with the pleasing
sound of their voices while we remained there. The nests were
placed among the tall slender grass that covered the southern part of
the island. They were more bulky and more neatly constructed than
any that I have examined southward of the Gulf of St Lawrence; and
yet they were not to be compared with those found in Labrador, where,
in every instance they were concealed under ledges of rocks extending
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
for several feet over them, so that I probably should not have
observed them, had not the birds flown off as I was passing. These
nests were made of dry moss, raised to the height of from six to nine
inches, and well finished within with slender grasses and feathers of
the Eider Duck. As usual however, the eggs were always four, when
the bird was sitting. They measure an inch and a quarter in length,
by an inch at their thickest part, so that they have a shortish and bulky
appearance, though they run almost to a point. They are smooth, and
handsomely marked with blotches of deep brown and others of a lighter
tint, on a greyish-yellow ground, the spots being larger and closer towards
the rounded end. Both sexes incubate, and remain with their
brood until the time of their departure.
</p>

<p>
My learned friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> has described the manners of
this species as observed in the neighbourhood of Boston, with so much
truth and accuracy, that I cannot do better than present you with his
account of it, the more especially, that in so doing, I have an opportunity
of expressing the high opinion I entertain of his talents and varied
accomplishments. “The Peet Weet is one of the most familiar and
common of all the New England marsh birds, arriving along our river
shores, and low meadows, about the beginning of May, from their mild
or tropical winter quarters in Mexico. As soon as it arrives on the coast,
small roving flocks are seen, at various times of the day, coursing rapidly
along the borders of our tide-water streams, flying swiftly and rather
low, in circular sweeps along the meanders of the rock or river, and
occasionally crossing from side to side, in rather a sportive and cheerful
mien, than as the needy foragers they appear at the close of the
autumn. While flying out in these wide circuits, agitated by superior
feelings to those of hunger and necessity, we hear the shores re-echo
the shrill and rapid whistle of ’weet, ’weet, ’weet, ’weet, and usually
closing the note with something like a warble, as they approach their
companions on the strand. The cry then varies to ’peet, ’weet, ’weet,
’weet, beginning high and gradually declining into a somewhat plaintive
tone. As the season advances, our little lively marine wanderers
often trace the streams some distance into the interior, resting usually
in fresh meadows among the grass, sometimes even near the house,
and I have seen their eggs laid in a strawberry bed; and the young and
old, pleased with their allowed protection, familiarly fed, and probed
the margin of the adjoining duck-pond, for their usual fare of worms
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
and insects. They have the very frequent habit of balancing or
wagging the tail, in which even the young join as soon as they are
fledged. From the middle to the close of May, the pairs, seceding
from their companions, seek out a place for their nest, which is
always in a dry open field of grass or grain, sometimes in the seclusion
and shade of a field of maize, but most commonly in a dry pasture,
contiguous to the sea shore; and in some of the solitary and small
sea islands, several pairs sometimes nestle near to each other, in the
immediate vicinity of the noisy nurseries of the quailing Terns. On
being flushed from her eggs, the female goes off without uttering
any complaint; but when surprised with her young, she practises all
the arts of dissimulation common to many other birds, fluttering in the
path, as if badly wounded, and generally proceeds in this way so far
as to deceive a dog, and cause it to overlook the brood, for whose protection
these instinctive arts are practised; nor are the young without
their artful instinct, for on hearing the reiterated cries of their parents,
they scatter about, and squatting still in the withered grass, almost
exactly their colour, it is with careful search very difficult to discover
them, so that in nine times out of ten, they would be overlooked, and only
be endangered by the tread, which they would endure sooner than betray
their cautious retreat.

“At a later period the shores and marshes resound with the quick,
clear, and oft-repeated note of peet weet, peet weet, followed up by a
plaintive call on the young, of peet, peet, peet? peet? If this is not
answered by the scattered brood, a reiterated ’weet, ’weet, ’weet, ’wait,
’wait, is heard, the voice dropping on the final syllables. The whole
marsh and the shores at times echo to this loud, lively, and solicitous
call of the affectionate parents for their brood. The cry, of course, is
most frequent toward evening, when the little family, separated by the
necessity of scattering themselves over the ground in quest of food,
are again desirous of reassembling to roost. The young, as soon as
hatched, run about the grass, and utter from the first a weak plaintive
peep, at length more frequent and audible; and an imitation of the
whistle of peet weet, is almost sure to meet with an answer from the
sympathizing broods, which now throng our marshes. When the note
appears to be answered, the parents hurry, and repeat their call with
great quickness. Young and old, previous to their departure, frequent
the sea shores, like most of the species, but never associate with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
other kinds, nor become gregarious, living always in families till the time
of their departure, which usually occurs about the middle of October.”
</p>

<p>
My esteemed friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Macculloch</span> of Pictou, Nova Scotia,
having transmitted to me a curious account of the attachment of one
of these birds to her eggs, I here insert it with pleasure. “Being
on an excursion to the Hardwood Heights, which rise to the west of
Pictou, my attention was attracted by the warble of a little bird, which
appeared to me entirely new, and which proceeded from a small thicket
a short way off. Whilst crossing an intervening meadow, I accidentally
raised a Spotted Sandpiper from its nest, and having marked the
spot I hastened forwards; but the shyness of the object of my pursuit
rendered all my efforts unavailing, and returning to the nest which I
had just left, I expected to find it still unoccupied; but the Sandpiper
had again resumed her place, and left it with great reluctance, on my
near approach. The nest contained four eggs, which I determined to
remove on my return at night, and for the purpose of preventing the
bird sitting again upon them, I placed a number of stones in a slanting
position over the nest, and so close that it was impossible for the
bird to get into it. On my return in the evening, however, I observed
the little creature rise from beside the stones apparently in greater
trepidation than ever, and more anxious to draw me away by the exhibition
of all those little arts which they practise for this purpose. On
examining the spot I was very much surprised to find that the poor
thing had not only hollowed out a new nest, but had actually succeeded
in abstracting two eggs from the other nest. How the bird had
contrived to remove the eggs I cannot conceive, as the stones remained
unaltered. This attachment to its nest and eggs appeared to me more
singular as the bird had just commenced incubation, the eggs exhibiting
very little appearance of the young.”
</p>

<p>
In addition to the observations of <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, I must inform
you that this species is often observed to alight on the branches
of trees hanging over water-courses, on which they walk deliberately,
and with their usual delicate elegance of gait, and balancing of both
body and tail. They are also wont to alight more frequently on the rails
and stakes of fences, or on walls. I have seen them on the tops
of hay-stacks, where they seemed to be engaged in pursuing insects.
On several occasions I have found their nests in orchards of both
peach and apple trees, at a considerable distance from water, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
use of which, indeed, they do not appear to require much during the
progress of incubation, or the first weeks after hatching their young,
when I have seen them rambling in search of food over large open
fields of sweet potatoes and other vegetables, in the neighbourhood of
some of our cities.
</p>

<p>
While these birds are flying, in the love season, the points of their
wings are considerably bent down, and they propel themselves by strong
and decided beats, supporting themselves afterwards by slow tremulous
motions of their pinions, to the distance of some yards, when they repeat
the strong beats, and thus continue until they realight, uttering
all the while their well-known notes, so accurately described by my
friend <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>.
</p>

<p>
In the autumnal months, along the shores of La Belle Riviere, I
have often with much delight watched the movements of these birds,
when I have been surprised to see the pertinacity with which, after
the first frosts, they would pursue their migration down the stream,
for on attempting to make them fly the other way, they would rise,
sometimes to the height of twenty yards, and flying over head or along
the river, proceed downwards, although at any other time they would
exhibit no such propensity. They run along the shores, and through
shallow water, with great nimbleness; and while courting, the male
struts before the female, with depressed wings, spreading out his tail
and trailing it along the ground, in the manner of the Migratory and
Rufous Thrushes.
</p>

<p>
The young become very fat in autumn, and afford delicious eating,
for as they feed much on worms, aquatic insects, and small mollusca,
their flesh seldom has a fishy taste. The male and female are
alike, and almost equal in size. The young differ from the old until
the approach of winter, when, with the exception of their being rather
smaller, no difference can be perceived.
</p>

<p>
This species occurs also in Europe, and a few individuals have been
shot in England.

<h2>
AMERICAN WHITE PELICAN.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Pelecanus Americanus.</i></span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXI. Adult Male</span>.
</p>


<p>
I feel great pleasure, good Reader, in assuring you, that our White
Pelican, which has hitherto been considered the same as that found in
Europe, is quite different. In consequence of this discovery, I have
honoured it with the name of my beloved country, over the mighty
streams of which, may this splendid bird wander free and unmolested
to the most distant times, as it has already done from the misty ages
of unknown antiquity.
</p>

<p>
In Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>’s Introduction to the second volume of the
Fauna Boreali-Americana, we are informed, that the <i>Pelecanus Onocrotalus</i>
(which is the bird now named <i>P. Americanus</i>) flies in dense
flocks all the summer in the fur countries. At page 472, the same intrepid
traveller says, that “Pelicans are numerous in the interior of
the fur countries up to the sixty-first parallel; but they seldom come
within two hundred miles of Hudson’s Bay. They deposit their eggs
usually on rocky islands, on the brink of cascades, where they can
scarcely be approached; but they are otherwise by no means shy birds.”
My learned friend also speaks of the “long thin bony process seen on
the upper mandible of the bill of this species;” and although neither
he nor Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span> pointed out the actual differences otherwise existing
between this and the European species, he states that no such appearance
has been described as occurring on the bills of the White Pelicans
of the old Continent.
</p>

<p>
When, somewhat more than thirty years ago, I first removed to
Kentucky, Pelicans of this species were frequently seen by me on the
sand-bars of the Ohio, and on the rock-bound waters of the rapids
of that majestic river, situated, as you well know, between Louisville
and Shippingport. Nay when, a few years afterwards, I established
myself at Henderson, the White Pelicans were so abundant that I often
killed several at a shot, on a well known sand-bar, which protects
Canoe Creek Island. During those delightful days of my early manhood,
how often have I watched them with delight! Methinks indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
Reader, those days have returned to me, as if to enable me the
better once more to read the scattered notes contained in my often-searched
journals.
</p>

<p>
Ranged along the margins of the sand-bar, in broken array, stand
a hundred heavy-bodied Pelicans. Gorgeous tints, all autumnal, enrich
the foliage of every tree around, the reflection of which, like
fragments of the rainbow, seems to fill the very depths of the placid
and almost sleeping waters of the Ohio. The subdued and ruddy
beams of the orb of day assure me that the Indian summer has commenced,
that happy season of unrivalled loveliness and serenity, symbolic
of autumnal life, which to every enthusiastic lover of nature
must be the purest and calmest period of his career. Pluming themselves,
the gorged Pelicans patiently wait the return of hunger.
Should one chance to gape, all, as if by sympathy, in succession open
their long and broad mandibles, yawning lazily and ludicrously.
Now, the whole length of their largest quills is passed through the
bill, until at length their apparel is as beautifully trimmed as if the
party were to figure at a route. But mark, the red beams of the setting
sun tinge the tall tops of the forest trees; the birds experience
the cravings of hunger, and to satisfy them they must now labour.
Clumsily do they rise on their columnar legs, and heavily waddle to
the water. But now, how changed do they seem! Lightly do they
float, as they marshal themselves, and extend their line, and now
their broad paddle-like feet propel them onwards. In yonder nook,
the small fry are dancing in the quiet water, perhaps in their own
manner bidding farewell to the orb of day, perhaps seeking something
for their supper. Thousands there are, all gay, and the very manner
of their mirth, causing the waters to sparkle, invites their foes to advance
toward the shoal. And now the Pelicans, aware of the faculties
of their scaly prey, at once spread out their broad wings, press
closely forward with powerful strokes of their feet, drive the little fishes
toward the shallow shore, and then, with their enormous pouches
spread like so many bag-nets, scoop them out and devour them in
thousands.
</p>

<p>
How strange it is, Reader, that birds of this species should be
found breeding in the Fur Countries, at about the same period when
they are to be found on the waters of the inland bays of the Mexican
Gulf! On the 2d of April 1837, I met with these birds in abundance at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
the south-west entrance or mouth of the Mississippi, and afterwards saw
them in the course of the same season, in almost every inlet, bay, or
river, as I advanced toward Texas, where I found some of them in
the Bay of Galveston, on the 1st of May. Nay, while on the Island
of Grande Terre, I was assured by Mr <span class="smcap">Andry</span>, a sugar-planter, who has
resided there for some years, that he had observed White Pelicans
along the shores every month of the year. Can it be, that in this
species of bird, as in many others, barren individuals should remain in
sections of countries altogether forsaken by those which are reproductive?
The latter, we know, travel to the Rocky Mountains and the
Fur Countries of the north, and there breed. Or do some of these
birds, as well as of certain species of our ducks, remain and reproduce
in those southern localities, induced to do so by some organic
or instinctive peculiarity? Ah, Reader, how little do we yet know of
the wonderful combinations of Nature’s arrangements, to render every
individual of her creation comfortable and happy under all the circumstances
in which they may be placed!
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, in a note to me, says that “this bird
is now more rare on our coast than it was thirty years ago; for I
have heard it stated that it formerly bred on the sand banks of our
Bird Islands. I saw a flock on the Bird Banks off Bull’s Island, on
the 1st day of July 1814, when I procured two full-plumaged old birds,
and was under the impression that they had laid eggs on one of those
banks, but the latter had the day previous to my visit been overflowed
by a spring tide, accompanied with heavy wind.”
</p>

<p>
A single pair of our White Pelicans were procured not far from
Philadelphia, on the Delaware or Schuylkill, ten or twelve years ago.
These were the only birds of this kind that, I believe, were ever observed
in our Middle Districts, where even the Brown Pelican, <i>Pelecanus
fuscus</i>, is never seen. Nor have I heard that an individual of either
species has ever been met with on any part of the shores of our
Eastern States. From these facts, it may be concluded that the
White Pelicans reach the Fur Countries of Hudson’s Bay by inland
journeys, and mostly by passing along our great western rivers in the
spring months, as they are also wont to do, though with less rapid
movements, in autumn.
</p>

<p>
Reader, I have thought a thousand times perhaps that the present
state of migration of many of our birds, is in a manner artificial, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
that a portion of the myriads of Ducks, Geese, and other kinds, which
leave our Southern Districts every spring for higher latitudes, were
formerly in the habit of remaining and breeding in every section of
the country that was found to be favourable for that purpose. It seems
to me that it is now on account of the difficulties they meet with, from
the constantly increasing numbers of our hostile species, that these
creatures are urged to proceed towards wild and uninhabited parts of
the world, where they find that security from molestation necessary
to enable them to rear their innocent progeny, but which is now denied
them in countries once their own.
</p>

<p>
The White American Pelican never descends from on wing upon
its prey, as is the habit of the Brown Pelican; and, although on many
occasions it fishes in the manner above described, it varies its mode
according to circumstances, such as a feeling of security, or the accidental
meeting with shoals of fishes in such shallows as the birds can
well compass. They never dive for their food, but only thrust their
head into the waters as far as their neck can reach, and withdraw it
as soon as they have caught something, or have missed it, for their
head is seldom out of sight more than half a minute at a time. When
they are upon rivers, they usually feed along the margin of the water,
though, I believe, mostly in swimming depth, when they proceed with
greater celerity than when on the sand. While thus swimming, you
see their necks extended, with their upper mandible only above the
water, the lower being laterally extended, and ready to receive whatever
fish or other food may chance to come into the net-like apparatus
attached to it.
</p>

<p>
As this species is often seen along the sea shores searching for
food, as well as on fresh water, I will give you a description of its
manners there. While on the Island of Barataria in April 1837, I
one afternoon observed a number of White Pelicans in company with
a flock of the Brown species, all at work, searching for food, the Brown
in the manner already described, the White in the following. They
all swam against the wind and current, with their wings partially extended,
and the neck stretched out, the upper mandible alone appearing
above the surface, while the lower must have been used as a scoop-net,
as I saw it raised from time to time, and brought to meet the upper,
when the whole bill immediately fell to a perpendicular position,
the water was allowed to run out, and the bill being again raised upwards,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
the fish was swallowed. After thus swimming for about an
hundred yards in an extended line, and parallel to each other, they
would rise on wing, wheel about, and realight at the place where their
fishing had commenced, when they would repeat the same actions.
They kept farther from the shore than the Brown Pelicans, and in deeper
water, though at times one of the latter would dive after fish close to
some of them, without their showing the least degree of enmity towards
each other. I continued watching them more than an hour,
concealed among a large quantity of drifted logs, until their fishing
was finished, when they all, White and Brown together, flew off to the
lee of another island, no doubt to spend the night there, for these birds
are altogether diurnal. When gorged, they retire to the shores, to
small islands in bays or rivers, or sit on logs floating in shallow water,
at a good distance from the beach; in all which situations they are
prone to lie down, or stand closely together.
</p>

<p>
Being anxious, when on my last expedition, to procure several specimens
of these birds for the purpose of presenting you with an account of
their anatomical structure, I requested all on board our vessel to shoot
them on all occasions; but no birds having been procured, I was obliged
to set out with a “select party” for the purpose. Having heard
some of the sailors say that large flocks of White Pelicans had been seen
on the inner islets of Barataria Bay, within the island called Grande
Terre, we had a boat manned, and my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, my son,
and myself, went off in search of them. After a while we saw large
flocks of these birds on some grounded logs, but found that it was no
easy matter to get near them, on account of the shallowness of the
bay, the water being scarcely two feet in depth for upwards of half a
mile about us. Quietly, and with all possible care, we neared a flock;
and strange it was for me to be once more within shooting distance of
White Pelicans. It would no doubt be a very interesting sight to you,
were you to mark the gravity and sedateness of some hundreds of these
Pelicans, closely huddled together on a heap of stranded logs, or a
small bank of racoon oysters. They were lying on their breasts, but
as we neared them they all arose deliberately to their full height.
Some, gently sliding from the logs, swam off towards the nearest
flock, as unapprehensive of danger as if they had been a mile distant.
But now their bright eyes were distinctly visible to us, our guns,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
charged with buckshot, were in readiness, and my son was lying in the
bow of the boat waiting for the signal. “Fire!”—The report is instantly
heard, the affrighted birds spread their wings and hurry away, leaving
behind three of their companions floating on the water. Another shot
from a different gun brought down a fourth from on wing; and as a
few were scampering off wounded, we gave chase, and soon placed all
our prizes in the after sheets. About a quarter of a mile farther on,
we killed two, and pursued several that were severely wounded in the
wing, but they escaped, for they swam off so rapidly that we could not
propel our boat with sufficient force amidst the tortuous shallows. The
Pelicans appeared tame, if not almost stupid; and at one place, where
there were about sixty on an immense log, could we have gone twenty
yards nearer, we might have killed eight or ten at a single discharge.
But we had already a full cargo, and therefore returned to the vessel,
on the decks of which the wounded birds were allowed to roam at large.
We found these Pelicans hard to kill, and some which were perforated
with buckshot did not expire until eight or ten minutes after they were
fired at. A wonderful instance of this tenacity of life was to be seen
on board a schooner then at anchor in the harbour. A Pelican had been
grazed on the hind part of the head with an ounce ball from a musket,
and yet five days afterwards it was apparently convalescent, and had
become quite gentle. When wounded, they swim rather sluggishly,
and do not attempt to dive, or even to bite, like the Brown Pelicans,
although they are twice as large, and proportionally stronger. After
being shot at, they are perfectly silent, but when alighted they utter
a hollow guttural sound somewhat resembling that produced by blowing
through the bung-hole of a cask.
</p>

<p>
The White Pelicans appear almost inactive during the greater
part of the day, fishing only soon after sunrise, and again about an
hour before sunset; though at times the whole flock will mount high
in the air, and perform extended gyrations in the manner of the Hooping
Crane, Wood Ibis, and Vultures. These movements are probably
performed for the purpose of assisting their digestion, and of airing
themselves, in the higher and cooler regions of the atmosphere.
Whilst on the ground, they at times spread their wings to the breeze,
or to the rays of the sun; but this act is much more rarely performed
by them than by the Brown Pelicans. When walking, they seem exceedingly
awkward, and like many cowardly individuals of our own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
species, are apt to snap at objects which they appear to know perfectly
to be so far superior to them as to disdain taking notice of them.
Their usual manner of flight is precisely similar to that of our Brown
species. It is said by authors that the White Pelican can alight on trees;
but I have never seen a single instance of its doing so. I am of opinion
that the ridge projecting from the upper mandible increases in
size as the bird grows older, and that it uses that apparatus as a means
of defence or of attack, when engaged with its rivals in the love-season.
</p>

<p>
The number of small fishes destroyed by a single bird of this species
may appear to you, as it did to me, quite extraordinary. While
I was at General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s plantation in East Florida, one of
them chanced to pass close over the house of my generous host,
and was brought dead to the ground. It was not a mature bird, but
apparently about eighteen months old. On opening it, we found in its
stomach several hundreds of fishes, of the size of what are usually
called minnows. Among the many which I have at different times examined,
I never found one containing fishes as large as those commonly
swallowed by the Brown species, which, in my opinion, is more likely
to secure a large fish by plunging upon it from on wing, than a bird
which must swim after its prey.
</p>

<p>
This beautiful species,—for, Reader, it is truly beautiful, and you
would say so were you to pick it up in all the natural cleanness of its
plumage, from the surface of the water,—carries its crest broadly expanded,
as if divided into two parts from the centre of the head. The
brightness of its eyes seemed to me to rival that of the purest diamond;
and in the love season, or the spring of the year, the orange-red colour
of its legs and feet, as well as of the pouch and bill, is wonderfully enriched,
being as represented in my plate, while during the autumnal
months these parts are pale. Its flesh is rank, fishy, and nauseous,
and therefore quite unfit for food, unless in cases of extreme necessity.
The idea that these birds are easily caught when gorged with fish, is
quite incorrect, for when approached, on such an occasion, they throw
up their food, as Vultures are wont to do.
</p>

<p>
I regret exceedingly that I cannot say any thing respecting their

they are said to breed.

Adult Male. Plate CCCXI.
</p>

<p>
Bill a little more than thrice the length of the head, rather slender,
almost straight, depressed. Upper mandible linear, depressed, convex
at the base, gradually flattened and a little enlarged to near the end,
when it again narrows, and terminates in a hooked point. The ridge is
broad and convex at the base, becomes gradually narrowed and flattened
beyond the middle, is elevated into a thin crest about an inch
high, of a fibrous structure, and about three inches in length (in some
specimens as much as five inches) which is continued forwards of less
elevation to the extent of an inch farther. The ridge of the mandible
is then narrow and flat, and terminates in the unguis, which is oblong,
slightly carinate above, curved, obtuse, concave beneath. The edges
are very sharp and a little involute; the lower surface of the mandible
has a median slender sharp ridge, on each side of which, at the distance
of a quarter of an inch is a stronger ridge having a groove in its
whole length; the sides then slope upwards to the incurved margin,
and in this latter space is received the edge of the other mandible.
Lower mandible having its crura separated, very slender, elastic, and
meeting only at the very extremity, so that the angle or interspace
may be described as extremely long, occupying in fact the whole length
of the bill excepting four-twelfths of an inch at the end; for two-thirds
of its length from the base, the lower mandible is broader than the upper,
which is owing to the crura lying obliquely, but beyond the crest
it is narrower; the extremely short dorsal line ascending, convex, the
edges inflected, sharp, and longitudinally grooved. To the lower mandible,
in place of the skin or membrane filling up the angle in most
other birds, is appended a vast sac seven inches in depth opposite the
base of the bill, and extending down the throat about eight inches, so
that its length from the tip of the lower mandible is twenty-one and a half
inches. It is formed of the skin, which is thin, transparent, elastic, rugous,
highly vascular, and capable of being expanded like a net, supported
by the elastic mandibles to the breadth of nine and a half inches.
</p>

<p>
Head small, oblong; neck long, stout; body full, rather flattened.
Feet short and very stout; tibia bare at its lower part, covered all
round with small scales; tarsus short, very stout, compressed, covered
all round with hexagonal scales, of which the anterior are much larger;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
toes in the same plane, all connected by reticulated webs, the first
shortest, the second an inch shorter than the fourth, which is considerably
longer than the third, scaly at the base, scutellate over the rest
of their extent. Claws short, strong, curved, rather blunt, that of
the middle toe with a sharp pectinate inner edge.
</p>

<p>
Feathers of the head and neck exceedingly small, slender, and of a
downy texture, those on the fore part of the head a little more compact;
on the nape they are elongated, acuminate, and form a longitudinal
narrow crest, which runs down the back of the neck. The feathers
in general are lanceolate, acuminate, and of moderately dense
texture; those at the junction of the neck and breast anteriorly are
stiffer and more elongated. Wings very long, rather narrow, rounded;
the humerus and cubitus very long in proportion; primaries much
curved; secondaries rather narrow, also incurved toward the end, the
inner extending when the wing is closed far beyond the tips of the primaries.
Tail short, broad, rounded, of <i>twenty-four</i> feathers, which are
broad and abruptly acuminate.
</p>

<p>
Bill bare, space about the eye, and feet, rich bright yellow, becoming
brighter before their departure for their breeding grounds; claws
yellowish-brown; tip of the bill brighter than the rest. Iris white, in
younger birds dusky. The general colour of the plumage is pure white;
the crest, the elongated feathers on the fore part of the breast, and
those near the edge of the cubitus, pale yellow. The alula, primary
coverts, and primary quills, black, the shafts white, becoming brownish-black,
toward the end. The inner ten secondaries are white, the rest
black, more or less tipped with greyish-white, their bases white, that
colour more extended on the inner than the outer, the shafts of all the
quills white beneath, those of the secondaries tinged with grey.

examination of several individuals in stating, is destitute of the horny
crest of the upper mandible.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A male, shot near Grande Terre, in the Gulf of Mexico, examined.
The skin is very thin, but the subcutaneous cellular tissue is extremely
developed, forming a thick reticular layer over the whole body. The
internal cells are also of vast size, the right hepatic being <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches
long, the right abdominal <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> by 4; the left abdominal <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> by 4; the
clavicular cell is not formed by a single cavity, but of numberless
cellules, like those of the subcutaneous tissue. The heart <i>n</i> is triangular,
pointed, 3 inches long, 2 inches and 10 twelfths in breadth;
the aorta branches at the base, as in other birds, sending off the two
trunks which separate into the subclavian and carotid. The lobes of
the liver are extremely unequal, the right, <i>o</i>, being 4 inches in length,
and <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> in breadth, while the left, <i>p</i>, is only 2 inches long, and <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch
broad.
</p>

<p>
The mandibles are entirely covered with skin, of which the subcutaneous
tissue is wanting, the cutis condensed, and the cuticle in large
irregular longitudinal plates, leaving the surface somewhat rough and
scaly. The crest-like excrescence on the ridge of the upper mandible
is not formed of bone, nor otherwise connected with the osseous surface,
which is smooth and continuous beneath it, than by being placed
upon it, like any other part of the skin, and when softened by immersion
in a liquid may be bent a little to either side. It is composed
internally of erect slender plates of a fibrous texture, externally of
horny fibres, which are erect on the sides, and longitudinal on the
broadened ridge; these fibres being continuous with the cutis and cuticle.
The skin of the mandible is continuous with that of the pouch,
of which the structure is as follows. Externally there is a layer of cuticle,
beneath which is the cutis, extremely thin, and with the cuticle
thrown into longitudinal rugæ when contracted. The internal surface
is also of cuticle, and beneath it is a layer of cutis. Between these
two very thin layers of skin, is interposed an equally thin layer, composed
of two sets of very slender muscular fibres, separated from each
other, and running in two opposite directions. The outer fibres run
in fasciculi from the lower and inner edge of the mandible; those from
its base pass downwards, those arising more anteriorly pass gradually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
more forwards, and spreading out, reach the middle line of the
pouch. The inner fibres have the same origin, and pass in a contrary
direction, backwards and inwards. From the hyoid bone to the junction
of the two crura of the mandible, which takes place almost at the
very tip, there extends a thin band of longitudinal muscular fibres, in
the centre of which is a cord of elastic tissue. By means of this apparatus,
the sac is contracted, so as to occupy little space. When the
bill is opened, the crura of the lower mandible separate from each
other to a considerable extent, by the action of the muscles inserted
into their base, this depending upon their oblique position, and the sac
is expanded. The upper mandible is capable of being moved to a considerable
extent.
</p>

<p>
Below the anterior angle of the eye is a small sac about 5 twelfths
of an inch in length, with an external aperture of 2 twelfths, and filled
with a pulpy substance. The nostrils are linear, about 3 twelfths of
an inch long, and quite concealed by the wrinkles of the skin. The
aperture of the posterior nares 8 twelfths. The tongue is an extremely
small, papilliform body, <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths of an inch long, and 1 twelfth in
diameter. The aperture of the glottis is linear, 8 twelfths in length,
destitute of papillæ behind.

</figure>

<p>
The pharynx is about <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches in breadth. The œsophagus <i>a</i>, at
the commencement, or opposite the tongue, has a diameter of about 6
inches, and contracts until the middle of the neck, where it is 3
inches in width; at its entrance into the thorax at <i>b</i> it contracts to <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inch, but is dilatable to 3 inches; at this part, its inner coat is thrown
into very prominent longitudinal rugæ. The structure of the œsophagus
is similar to that of the Loon already described, but its muscular
coat is much thinner. On entering the thorax, it again expands to a
diameter of 3 inches. Its length from the glottis, exclusive of the proventriculus,
is 2 feet. The proventriculus, <i>cd</i>, when not extended,
has a diameter of 2 inches, its length being 4 inches and 8 twelfths.
It is marked internally with six longitudinal broad ridges, about half
an inch in breadth, and separated by grooves; and its cuticular lining
is <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths thick, of a compact but soft texture, elevated into tortuous
reticulated ridges. The glandules, which are cylindrical, the
largest 3 twelfths of an inch long, <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> twelfth in diameter, form a complete
elongated belt. The muscular coat is also very thick, its inner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
layer composed of transverse, its outer of longitudinal fibres, and the
greatest thickness of the walls of the proventriculus is about <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
twelfths of an inch. The stomach, <i>e</i>, properly so called, is extremely
small, being of a roundish, compressed form, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches in length, and
of the same breadth; its muscular coat composed of slender fasciculi,
and not presenting a distinction into lateral and inferior muscles, its
inner coat smooth. Appended to it on the right side is a sac <i>f</i>, of a
roundish form, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">9</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inch in length, and <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> in breadth, joining it by a
contraction, of which the diameter is <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> inch, and opening directly into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
the proventriculus, as well as into the stomach; its walls thin, its
inner surface smooth, with numerous mucous crypts irregularly disposed.
The pylorus, <i>g</i>, is exceedingly small, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths in diameter,
with a thickened margin.
</p>

<p>
The duodenum <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, passes backwards and upwards to the length
of <span class="mixfract">6&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches, returns upon itself enclosing the pancreas, receives the
biliary ducts at the distance of 14 inches from the pylorus. The gall-bladder
is oblong, 2 inches long, and 10 twelfths broad. The intestine
then forms numerous convolutions, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, occupying the whole abdomen,
and lying in part over the stomach and proventriculus. Its entire
length is 10 feet 10 inches. Its diameter varies little, it being at
the upper part 5 twelfths of an inch, towards the rectum <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths.
The rectum is <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, including the cloaca, <i>m</i>, which is globular,
and about <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches in diameter. The cœca are 1 inch and 1
twelfth in length, 4 twelfths in diameter, cylindrical, rounded at the
end. The muscular coat of the intestine is very strong, the inner villous.
</p>

<p>
One of the testes is 1 inch long, the other <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>; their form oblong.
In the proventriculus and stomach is a vast accumulation of small
lumbrici, about <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch in length, and amounting to about 1000.
</p>

<p>
The trachea is 1 foot 10 inches long, a little flattened, <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> inch in diameter
throughout, but a little narrower about the middle; the rings
160, not ossified, excepting the lower. The contractor muscles are very
small; as are the sterno-tracheal; and the inferior larynx is destitute
of muscles. The bronchi are large, 5 twelfths in diameter, of 25 half
rings.
</p>

<p>
The upper mandible is hollow in its whole extent; but the lateral
spaces intervening between the edges of the median bone or ridge and
the margins, are filled with a beautiful net-work of bony spiculæ. The
two superior maxillary branches of the fifth pair of nerves, which are
very large, being about 1 twelfth of an inch in diameter at the base,
run close together along the median line, sending off branches at intervals,
and extending to the end of the mandible. The lower mandible
is also hollow, and similarly reticulated. The inferior maxillary
branch, having entered on the inner side at the base, runs in like manner
along its whole length, and is of the same thickness; by an aperture
on the outer side near the base, it sends off a branch almost as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
thick, which runs within the membrane of the gular sac, parallel to the
mandible, and about half an inch distant from it, sending off branches
at intervals. The sac is plentifully supplied with blood vessels.
</p>

<p>
The nasal cavity is of an oblong form, 1 inch and 5 twelfths in
length, passing obliquely backwards and upwards from the aperture of
the posterior nares, and opening externally by curving forwards; its
greatest diameter 5 twelfths, in its lower third 3 twelfths, and so continuing
until it expands into the inferior slit-like aperture, which is 8
twelfths long. The cavity of the nose is thus small, and the olfactory
nerve, which passes out from the anterior part of the brain, is a slender
filament, about <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">3</span></span> of a twelfth in diameter. It runs at first through a
bony tube, then passes along the bony septum of the orbits, in contact
for a short space with the superior maxillary nerve of the fifth pair,
which at its commencement makes a great curve upwards, and crosses
the orbit to enter the maxillary cavity, which has no communication
with the olfactory. Fig. 2 represents the sternum viewed from before.
It is remarkable chiefly for its great breadth and convexity. Its sides,
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, are nearly parallel; its posterior margin broad, with two
shallow notches, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, separated by a short conical obtuse median process.
The crest or ridge, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, is carried forward in front, where it is only,
however, of moderate height, and is not continued to the posterior extremity,
but terminates at <i>i</i>, in the most convex part. The coracoid
bones, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, are extremely large, very broad at their lower part, and
having a deep groove and thin elongated process, <i>j</i>, at the upper for the
tendon of the pectoralis medius, which raises the wing. The furcula,
<i>k</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, is anchylosed with the crest of the sternum, at <i>h</i>, has its crura
moderately stout and much diverging, and its upper extremity very
broad and recurvate. The scapula, of which only the anterior process
<i>t</i>, <i>l</i>, is seen, is small. A sternal apparatus like this indicates a steady
and powerful flight, the wings being supported upon a very firm basis,
and well separated. The great mass of the pectoral muscle being
thrown forward, it acts more directly than in such birds as the Gallinæ
and Ducks, in which it is placed farther backwards, and although its
bulk is not so great as in them, it is more advantageously situated.
The sternal apparatus of this Pelican is thus extremely similar to that
of the Cormorant, and the American Anhinga, and is also constructed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
on the same plan as that of the Gannets, although in the latter its
body is more elongated.

LONG-TAILED DUCK.

<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXII. Male and Female in Summer, Male in Winter,
and unfledged Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
In the course of one of my rambles along the borders of a large
fresh-water lake, near Bras-d’or in Labrador, on the 28th of July 1833,
I was delighted by the sight of several young broods of this species of
Duck, all carefully attended to by their anxious and watchful mothers.
Not a male bird was on the lake, which was fully two miles distant from
the sea, and I concluded that in this species, as in many others, the
males abandon the females after incubation has commenced. I watched
their motions a good while, searching at the same time for the nests,
one of which I was not long in discovering. Although it was quite destitute
of anything bearing the appearance of life, it still contained the
down which the mother had plucked from herself for the purpose of
keeping her eggs warm. It was placed under an alder bush, among
rank weeds, not more than eight or nine feet from the edge of the
water, and was formed of rather coarse grass, with an upper layer of
finer weeds, which were neatly arranged, while the down filled the
bottom of the cavity, now apparently flattened by the long sitting of
the bird. The number of young broods in sight induced me to search
for more nests, and in about an hour I discovered six more, in one of
which I was delighted to find two rotten eggs. They measured 2 inches
and <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span> long, by <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup"><span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span></span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> broad, were of a uniform pale yellowish-green, and
quite smooth.
</p>

<p>
My young companions had, unfortunately for me, walked that
morning to Blanc Sablon, about thirty miles distant, down the Straits
of Belle Isle; and having no dog to assist me in procuring some of the
young ducks, I was obliged to enact the part of one myself, although
the thermometer that day was 45° 50´, and the atmosphere felt chilly.
I gave chase to the younglings, which made for different parts of the
shore, as I followed them up to my middle in the water, while they
dived before me like so many Water-witches, the mothers keeping
aloof, and sounding their notes of alarm and admonition. I was fortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
enough to procure several of the young birds, and afterwards shot
one of the old, which having young much smaller than the rest, was
more anxious for their safety, and kept with them within shot. She
and the young were afterwards put in rum, to be subsequently examined.
I counted eleven broods on the same pond, and Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span> assured
me that these birds always breed in numbers together, but rarely
on the same lake two successive years. Their plumage was ragged,
in so far as I could judge, and the individual which I shot was similar.
They never dived while in my sight, but seemed constantly to urge
their young to do so, and the little things so profited by the advice of
their parents, that had they remained in the water, instead of making,
after a while, for the land, I believe I should not have succeeded, after
all my exertions, in capturing a single one of them.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman above mentioned informed me that the old birds
keep the young in the ponds until they are quite able to fly, or until
the end of August, when the flocks remove on wing to the sea, and
soon after leave the coast, seldom reappearing before the first days of
May, or about two weeks before most other kinds of ducks. The little
ones which I procured, were as you see them represented in my plate.
Those that were larger were of the same colour, and none shewed any
feathers on their bodies. Now and then, like all other young ducks,
they would skim over the surface of the water with astonishing rapidity,
emitting a sharp note somewhat resembling the syllables <i>pee</i>,
<i>pee</i>, <i>pee</i>, and would then dive with the quickness of thought. When
squatted among the moss, they allowed me to take them without making
any attempt to escape. The young were put in a tub, and had
some soaked biscuit placed near them; but they were all found dead
the next morning.
</p>

<p>
The range of this noisy, lively, and beautiful duck, extends along
our coast as far south as Texas, and it is also found at the mouth
of the Columbia River; but the species is never found on any of
our fresh-water courses, and I am quite confident that Mr <span class="smcap">Say</span> mistook
for it the Pintail Duck, <i>Anas acuta</i>, when he says that he found it on
the waters of the Missouri. During all my residence in the neighbourhood
of the Mississippi, and in the course of all my journeys on and
along its waters, I never saw one of these birds, or heard of any having
occurred on that stream above its confluence with the Gulf of Mexico;
whereas the Pintails are extremely abundant there, as well as on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
Missouri, the Ohio, and all our western streams, in spring and autumn.
Few Long-tailed Ducks are to be seen in the market of New Orleans,
and in fact they are altogether what our gunners usually call “sea
ducks.”
</p>

<p>
The period of the first appearance of this species in autumn depends
much on the state of the weather. I have known a difference
of a whole month in the Sound, and quite as much in Chesapeake Bay,
in both of which it is most abundant in winter, rarely proceeding farther
south until driven away by extreme cold. Their advance from
Labrador and Newfoundland along the coast, until they reach Long
Island, is more hurried than afterwards. They arrive in small flocks,
which are soon joined by others, and as they are prone to congregate, vast
numbers are seen together in winter, when their cacklings, though different
from those of our frogs in spring, are almost as incessant from
sunset until dawn. For my part, I have never perceived any resemblance
which their notes bear to the words “south-southerly,” but think their
noisy cries as duckish as those of the Mallard, although sharper and
more musical. The best imitation is given by my friend <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>,
but if you attempt to reduce the syllables to sounds, there is some
probability of your at least succeeding in exciting laughter in yourself
or others. He says the notes are “ogh, ough, egh,” and again “ogh,
ogh, ogh, ough, egh,” and adds that they are guttural, and have a ludicrous
drawling tone. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that “the peculiar cry
of this duck is celebrated in the songs of the Canadian voyagers.” This
to my mind would imply that the Long-tailed Ducks are seen by these
adventurous travellers on the waters of the inland streams, which
would appear to be at variance with their usual habits, for unless during
the breeding season, they give a decided preference to the sea;
and indeed generally keep in deep water. Owing to their reiterated
cries these birds are named “Noisy Ducks;” but they have various
appellations, among others those of “old wives,” and “old squaws.”

Although, like all sea-ducks, the “Old Wife” swims deeply, it moves
with a grace and celerity, which if not superior to those of any of its
tribe, are at least equal; and when the weather is rough, and the
waters agitated, it raises its tail in the same manner as the Ruddy
Duck and Pintail. When advancing in smooth water, its speed is
such as to cause a considerable swell before it, such as sea-faring persons
usually call a “bone.” Like all others of its tribe, it also prefers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
swimming against both wind and tide, as then it can sooner take
wing if necessary. In calm and pleasant weather, like its congeners,
it is fond of throwing its body almost over, and of pluming itself in
that position. When on wing, the long feathers of its tail do not
seem to aid its progress, any more than in other species.
</p>

<p>
It seldom removes from the north on its way to our Middle Districts
in large flocks; but at the approach of the breeding season, and
after the birds appear to be all paired, they fly northward in long lines,
or broad fronts, moving high or low according to the state of the
weather, passing at times at a considerable distance from the shores,
but flying close to the points of every cape, although they never pass
over an isthmus however narrow. Their flight is swift, well sustained,
and accompanied with a well-marked whistling of their wings. Being
expert divers, it is difficult to kill them on the water; and if you happen
to wound one but slightly, I would advise you, Reader, to give
up the chase, unless you have hit it while on the ice, in which case you
will find that it runs rather awkwardly. Their flesh is none of the
best, being dark, generally tough, and to the taste fishy; for which
reason they are now-a-days frequently brought to our markets plucked,
with the head and feet cut off, and called by the venders by all names
excepting old wives, squaws, noisy ducks, or south-southerlies. The
food of this species consists chiefly of shell-fish; but in the stomachs
of those killed on fresh water in Labrador, I found small fishes, and a
quantity of grass and its roots.
</p>

<p>
From the great number of specimens which I have procured in our
Middle Districts in winter, and those which I have seen killed during
the love season in the north, I am induced to think that the elongated
feathers of the tail of this species scarcely if at all, differ in length at
these different periods, although some writers have said that in spring
they are much longer than in winter, in which latter season, however,
I think the old males differ only in the colour of their plumage from
their state in spring. I have obtained male specimens at New York
and at Baltimore early in March, when they were already much changed
from their appearance in winter; but my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> informs me
that he has never seen one with any appearance of the summer plumage
at Charleston in South Carolina, where however, he adds, this
species is not common.
</p>

<p>
I have represented two male birds, one in its full spring dress, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
other in that of winter. You will also find in the same plate the first
figure ever given of an adult female, accompanied with as many younglings
as I could conveniently introduce. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> gave the figure of a
young male in the first winter as that of a female.

<h2>
BLUE-WINGED TEAL.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Anas discors</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Is it not strange, Reader, that birds which are known to be abundant
on the Saskatchewan River during the breeding season, and
which have been observed as far north as the 57th parallel, should also
be found breeding at nearly the same period in Texas? Stranger still
it is that species should proceed from certain points, or winter quarters,
to both of the above-mentioned regions, without paying any regard to
the intermediate districts, which yet seem to be as well adapted for
breeding in, as they afford thousands of convenient and secluded localities
for that purpose. Yet these facts, and many others connected
with Nature’s wonderful arrangements, we may look upon as intended
to increase the innate desire which every true lover of Nature has to
study her beautiful and marvellous works.
</p>

<p>
Having for some years observed such habits exhibited by the Blue-winged
Teal and other birds, I have been induced to believe in the
existence of what I would term <i>a double sense of migration</i> in many
species, acted upon both in spring and in autumn, and giving to them
at the latter period, the power as well as the desire of removing
from the higher latitudes to opposite or meridional parts, thus to enter
into the formation of the Fauna of different countries, from which
again they are instigated to return to the place of their nativity, and
thence diverge toward new sections of the globe equally adapted to
their wants. If these observations should prove not unfounded, we
need no longer be surprised to meet in different portions of the world
with species which hitherto were supposed to be inhabitants only of far
distant shores.
</p>

<p>
The mouths of the Mississippi, surrounded by extensive flat marshes,
which are muddy, and in some degree periodically inundated by the
overflowings of that great stream, or by the tides of the Mexican Gulf,
and having in the winter months a mildness of temperature favourable
to almost all our species of Waders and Swimmers, may be looked upon
as the great rendezvous of the Blue-winged Teals, which are seen arriving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
there coastways, in autumn and the greater part of winter, to
meet the multitudes that have travelled across the interior from the
north and west. At New Orleans, and during spring, when this bird
is in full plumage, it is called by the Creoles of Louisiana “Sarcelle
Printanniere;” and in autumn, when scarcely an individual can be seen
retaining the beauty of its spring plumage, it is known as the “Sarcelle
Automniere;” in consequence of which double appellation, many
persons imagine that there are two Blue-winged Teals.
</p>

<p>
They are the first ducks that arrive in that part of the country,
frequently making their appearance in the beginning of September,
in large flocks, when they are exceedingly fat. They depart, however,
when the cold becomes so intense as to form ice; and in this respect
they differ from the Green-winged Teals, which brave the coldest
weather of that country. Toward the end of February, however, they
are as abundant as ever, but they are then poor, although their plumage
is perfected, and the males are very beautiful. During their
stay, they are seen on bayous and ponds, along the banks of the Mississippi,
and on the large and muddy sand-bars around, feeding on
grasses and their seeds, particularly in autumn, when they are very
fond of the wild pimento. Many remain as late as the 15th of May,
in company with the Shoveller and Gadwall Ducks, with which they
are usually fond of associating.
</p>

<p>
On my reaching the south-western pass of the Mississippi, on the
1st April 1837, I found these birds very abundant there, in full plumage,
and in flocks of various sizes. On the 11th of the same month,
when about an hundred miles to the westward, we saw large and dense
flocks flying in the same direction. On the 15th, at Derniere Isle, the
Blue-wings were very plentiful and gentle. Two days after, they were
quite as numerous round Rabbit Island, in the Bay called Cote Blanche;
and on the 26th they were found on all the ponds and salt bayous or
inlets of Galveston Island in Texas, as well as on the water-courses
of the interior, where I was assured that they bred in great numbers.
Though on account of the nature of the localities in which these Teals
breed, and which cannot be explored otherwise than in extremely light
canoes, or by risking being engulphed in oozy morasses covered with
tall grass, we were not so fortunate as to find any of their nests, we
could easily judge by their manœuvres both while on wing and on the
water, that we were not far from their well-concealed treasures and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
the females which we procured unequivocally exhibited the state of
exhaustion common in the course of incubation.
</p>

<p>
During the months of September and October, this species is plentiful
on the Ohio, and in the whole of the Western Country, through
which they pass again in April, but without tarrying. On the other
hand, they seem to prolong their stay at this season in our Eastern Districts
more than in autumn; and this is also the case in South Carolina,
as I learn from the observations of my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>,
who has seen them mated there as early as February. I have found
them in the Boston markets on the 8th of September, but it is very
rare to see any of them there in full spring dress. I saw or heard of none
when I was in Labrador and Newfoundland; from which it may be inferred
that those found in the Fur Countries reach them through the
interior. They also occur on the Columbia River. On the 21st of
March 1821, I saw many Blue-winged Teals copulating on the Mississippi,
a little below Natchez; yet none of these birds have been
known to breed in that section of the country. They were at the time
mentioned on a sand-bar in company with some American Widgeons,
which also were similarly employed.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Blue-winged Teal is extremely rapid and well
sustained. Indeed, I have thought that, when travelling, it passes
through the air with a speed equal to that of the Passenger Pigeon.
When flying in flocks in clear sunny weather, the blue of their wings
glistens like polished steel, so as to give them the most lively appearance;
and while they are wheeling over the places in which they intend
to alight, their wings being alternately thrown in the shade and
exposed to the bright light, the glowing and varied lustre thus produced,
at whatever distance they may be, draws your eyes involuntarily
towards them. When advancing against a stiff breeze, they alternately
shew their upper and lower surfaces, and you are struck by
the vivid steel-blue of their mantle, which resembles the dancing light
of a piece of glass suddenly reflected on a distant object. During their
flight, they almost constantly emit their soft lisping note, which they
also utter when alighted and under apprehension of danger. I have
never observed them travelling in company with other ducks, but have
seen them at times passing over the sea at a considerable distance from
land. Before alighting, and almost under any circumstances, and in
any locality, these Teals pass and repass several times over the place,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
as if to assure themselves of the absence of danger, or, should there be
cause of apprehension, to watch until it is over. They swim buoyantly,
and generally in a close body, at times nearly touching each
other. Indeed, during their first appearance in autumn, when you
are apt to meet with a flock entirely composed of young birds, you
may, by using a little care, kill a considerable number at one shot. I
was assured by a gunner residing at New Orleans, that as many as one
hundred and twenty had been killed by himself at a single discharge;
and I myself saw a friend of mine kill eighty-four by pulling together
the triggers of his double-barrelled gun!
</p>

<p>
The Blue-winged Teal is easily kept in captivity, and soon becomes
very docile. In this state it feeds freely on coarse corn meal, and I
have no doubt that it could readily be domesticated, in which case, so
tender and savoury is its flesh that it would quickly put the merits of
the widely celebrated Canvass-backed Duck in the shade.
</p>

<p>
In the course of my stay in East Florida, at General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s,
and Mr <span class="smcap">Bulow</span>’s, I have observed this Teal in company with the Red-breasted
Snipe, the Tell-tale Godwit, and the Yellow-shank Snipe. I
observed the same circumstance in Texas.
</p>

<p>
During the time of their residence on the Delaware River, they
feed principally on the seeds of the wild oats, which I also found them
to do whilst at Green Bay. I have been assured by persons residing
on the island of Cuba, that the Blue-winged Teal is abundant, and
breeds there.
</p>

<p>
The old males lose the spring plumage of the head almost entirely
during a great portion of the autumn and winter, but it is reassumed
sometimes as early as the beginning of January. The young of both
sexes in their first plumage resemble the females, but the males acquire
their full beauty before they are a year old.

<h2>
BLACK-HEADED, OR LAUGHING GULL.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Larus Atricilla</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXIV. Male in spring, and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
Before entering upon the peculiar habits of this Gull, allow me,
good-natured Reader, to present you with some general observations
on the genus to which it belongs.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of autumn, it frequently happens that the young
birds of several species associate together, congregating at times in
vast numbers, and especially during low tides, on the outer margins of
sand-bars situated in estuaries. There you may hear them keeping up
an almost incessant cackle, and see them running about dressing their
plumage, or patiently waiting the rising of the waters, on which much
desired event taking place, they generally disperse, and fly off to search
for food. If disturbed while thus reposing, they shew greater shyness,
perhaps, than at any other time, and the loud note of alarm from one
of the group soon reaches your ear. Look at them now, Reader, as
they simultaneously spread their wings, and after a step or two launch
into the air, gradually ascend, and in silence rise to a great height,
performing extended gyrations, and advancing toward the open sea.
</p>

<p>
It seldom happens that when one of the larger species is shot, its
companions will come to the rescue, as is the case with the smaller,
such as the Kittiwake, and the present species. I have thought it
remarkable how keenly and aptly Gulls generally discover at once the
intentions towards them of individuals of our own species. To the
peaceable and industrious fisherman they scarcely pay any regard, whether
he drags his heavy net along the shore, or patiently waits until his
well-baited hook is gulped below the dancing yet well-anchored bark,
over the side of which he leans in constant and anxious expectation. At
such a time indeed, if the fisher has had much success, and his boat displays
a good store, Gulls will almost assail him like so many beggars, and
perhaps receive from him a trifling yet dainty morsel. But, on the opposite
side of the bay, see how carefully and suspiciously the same
birds are watching every step of the man who, with a long gun held in
a trailing position, tries to approach the flock of sleeping Widgeons.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
Why, not one of the Gulls will go within three times the range of his
murderous engine; and, as if to assure him of their knowledge of his
designs, they merely laugh at him from their secure station.
</p>

<p>
When congregated during the love-season, their loquacity has never
failed to remind me of the impetuous, unmusical, and yet not unpleasant
notes of our thieving Red-winged Starlings. But when apart, and
at all times excepting the periods of pairing or breeding, or while some
of the smaller species are chased by their vigilant enemies the Jagers,
they are usually silent birds, especially when on wing. In rainy or
squally weather, they skim low over the water, or the land, always
against the wind, passing at times within a few feet of the surface.
Again, at such times, I have observed Gulls of every species with which
I am acquainted, suddenly give a shake or two to their wings, and stop
as it were for a moment in their flight, as if they had espied something
worthy of their attention below; but, on closely observing them, I have
become convinced that such manœuvres were performed only with the
view of readjusting their whole plumage, which had perhaps been disarranged
by a side current of wind.
</p>

<p>
All Gulls are wonderfully tenacious of life.  When wounded or
closely pursued, they are very apt to disgorge their food, or to sustain
themselves against the agonies of death with uncommon vigour. They
appear indeed to be possessed of extraordinary powers of respiration,
through means of which they revive at the very moment when you might
conceive them to have actually reached the last gasp. I have seen cases
in which individuals of this tribe, after having been strongly squeezed
for several minutes across the body, and after their throats had been
crammed with cotton or tow, recovered as soon as the pressure was
remitted, and immediately attempted to bite with as much eagerness as
when first seized, when, by the by, they are wont to mute, as well as
when suddenly surprised and taking to wing. In certain states of the
atmosphere, Gulls, as well as other birds, appear much larger than they
actually are; and on such occasions, they, of course, seem nearer than you
would find them to be; for which reason, I would advise you, Reader,
to be on your guard, for you may be strangely misled as to the distance
at which you suppose the bird to be, and pull your trigger merely to
send your shot into the sand, far short from the Gulls or other light-coloured
birds in view.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Much confusion appears to exist among authors regarding our
Laughing Gull, and this, in my humble opinion, simply because not one
of them has studied it, in its native haunts, and at all seasons, since the
period when it was briefly characterized by our great master <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>,
who, after all that has been said against him, has not yet had his equal.
<span class="smcap">Alexander Wilson</span>, who, it seems, knew something of the habits of
this bird, thought it however identical with the <i>Larus ridibundus</i> of
Europe as is shewn by the synonyms which he has given. Others, who
only examined some dried skins, without knowing so much as the day
or even the year in which they had been shot, or their sex, or whether
the feathers before them had once belonged to a bird that was breeding,
or barren, when it was procured, described its remains perhaps
well enough for their own purpose, but certainly not with all the
accuracy which is necessary to establish once and for ever a distinct
species of bird. Others, not at all aware that most Gulls, and the present
species in particular, assume, in the season of pairing, and in a
portion of the breeding time, beautiful rosy tints in certain parts of
their plumage, which at other periods are pure white, have thought
that differences of this sort, joined to those of the differently-sized
white spots observable in particular specimens, and not corresponding
with the like markings in other birds of the same size and form, more
or less observable at different periods on the tips of the quills, were
quite sufficient to prove that the young bird, and the breeding bird,
and the barren bird, of one and the same species, differed specifically
from the old bird, or the winter-plumage bird. But, Reader, let us
come to the point at once.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of the breeding season, or, as I like best to term
it, the love season, this species becomes first hooded, and the white
feathers of its breast, and those of the lower surface of its wings, assume
a rich blush of roseate tint. If the birds procured at that time
are several years old and perfect in their powers of reproduction, which
is easily ascertained on the spot, their primary quills shew little or no
white at their extremities, and their hood descends about three quarters
of an inch lower on the throat than on the hind part of the head,
provided the bird be a male. But should they be barren birds, <i>the hood
will be wanting</i>, that portion of their plumage remaining as during winter,
and although the primaries will be black, or nearly so, each of them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
will be broadly tipped, or marked at the end, with a white spot, which
in some instances will be found to be fully half an inch in size; yet
the tail of these birds, as if to prove that they are adults, is as purely
white to its extreme tip, as in those that are breeding; but neither the
breast, nor the under wing-coverts, will exhibit the rosy tint of one in
the full perfection of its powers.
</p>

<p>
The males of all the Gulls with which I am acquainted, are larger
than the females; and this difference of size is observable in the young
birds even before they are fully fledged. In all of these, however, putting
aside their sex, I have found great differences of size to exist, sometimes
as much as two inches in length, with proportional differences in
the bills, tarsi, and toes; and this, in specimens procured from one flock
of these gulls at a single discharge of the gun, and at different seasons of
the year. The colour of their bills too is far from being always alike, being
brownish-red in some, purplish or of a rich and deep carmine in
others. As to the white spots on the extremities of the primary quills
of birds of this family, I would have you, Reader, never to consider
them as affording essential characters. Nay, if you neglect them altogether,
you will save yourself much trouble, as they will only mislead
you by their interminable changes, and you may see that the spots
on one wing are sometimes different in size and number from those on
the other wing of the same specimen. If all this be correct, as I assure
you it must be, being the result of numberless observations made in
the course of many years, in the very places of resort of our different
Gulls, will you not agree with me, Reader, that the difficulty of distinguishing
two very nearly allied species must be almost insuperable
when one has nothing better than a few dried skins for objects of observation
and comparison?
</p>

<p>
The Black-headed Gull may be said to be a constant resident along
the southern coast of the United States, from South Carolina to the
Sabine River; and I have found it abundant over all that extent both
in winter and in summer, but more especially on the shores and keys
of the Floridas, where I found it breeding, as well as on some islands
in the Bay of Galveston in Texas. A very great number of these birds
however remove, at the approach of spring, towards the Middle and
Eastern Districts, along the shores of which they breed in considerable
numbers, particularly on those of New Jersey and Long Island, as well

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
to reproduce out of season, as it were. On some such occasions, when
I was at St Augustine, in the month of December, I have observed
four or five males of the present species paying their addresses to one
female, who received their courtesies with evident welcome. Yet the
females in that country did not deposit eggs until the 20th day of April.
The most surprising fact of all was, that, although these birds were
paired, and copulated regularly, by the 1st of February, not one had
acquired the spring or summer plumage, or the dark coloured hood, or
the rosy tint of the breast, nor lost the white spots on the tips of their
primary quills. This change, however, was apparent by the 5th of
March, became daily stronger, and was perfected by the 15th of that
month. A few exceptions occurred among the numbers procured at
these periods, but the generality of the birds were as above described.
</p>

<p>
Whilst at Great Egg Harbour, in May 1829, shortly after my return
from England, I found this species breeding in great numbers on
the margins of a vast salt marsh, bordering the sea-shore, though separated
from the Atlantic by a long and narrow island. About sunrise
every morning, an immense number of these birds would rise in the
air, as if by common consent, and wing their way across the land, probably
intent on reaching the lower shores of the Delaware River, or
indeed farther towards the head waters of Chesapeake Bay. They
formed themselves into long straggling lines, following each other singly,
at the distance of a few yards. About an hour before sunset, the
same birds were seen returning in an extended front, now all silent, although
in the morning their cries were incessant, and lasted until they
were out of sight. On arriving at the breeding ground, they immediately
settled upon their nests. On a few occasions, when it rained
and blew hard, the numbers that left the nests were comparatively
few, and those, as I thought, mostly males. Instead of travelling high,
as they were wont to do in fair and calm weather, they skimmed closely
over the land, contending with the wind with surprising pertinacity,
and successfully too. At such times they were also quite silent. I
now and then observed some of them whilst on wing, and at a considerable
height, suddenly check their course, as if to examine some object
below; but on none of these occasions did I see one attempt to
alight, for it soon resumed its wonted course, and rejoined its companions.
</p>

<p>
Now, Reader, though I am growing old, I yet feel desirous of acquiring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
knowledge regarding the habits of our birds, and should much
like to learn from you the reasons why these gulls went off in lines
from their breeding grounds, and returned in an extended front?
Was it, in the latter case, because they were afraid of passing their
nests unknowingly; or, in the former, under the necessity of following
an experienced leader, who, under the stimulus of an empty maw,
readily undertook the office, but who, like many other bon-vivants, became
in the evening too dull to be of use to his companions?
</p>

<p>
This species breeds, according to the latitude, from the 1st of
March to the middle of June; and I have thought that on the Tortuga
Keys, it produced two broods each season. In New Jersey, and farther
to the eastward, the nest resembles that of the Ring-billed Gull,
or Common American Gull, <i>Larus zonorhynchus</i>, being formed of dried
sea-weeds, and land plants, two and sometimes three inches high, with
a regular rounded cavity, from four and a half to five inches in diameter,
and an inch and a half in depth. This cavity is formed of finer
grasses, placed in a pretty regular circular form. I once found a nest
formed as it were of two; that is to say, two pairs had formed a nest
of nearly double the ordinary size, and the two birds sat close to each
other during rainy weather, but separately, each on its own three eggs.
I observed that the males, as well as the females, thus concerned in
this new sort of partnership, evinced as much mutual fondness as if
they were brothers. On the Tortugas, where these Gulls also breed
in abundance, I found their eggs deposited in slight hollows scooped
in the sand. Whilst at Galveston, in Texas, I found their nests
somewhat less bulky than in the Jerseys, which proved to me how
much birds are guided in these matters by differences in atmospheric
temperature and locality.
</p>

<p>
I never found more than three eggs in a nest. Their average length
is two inches and half an eighth, their greatest breadth a trifle more
than an inch and a half. They vary somewhat in their general tint,
but are usually of a light earthy olive, blotched and spotted with dull
reddish-brown and some black, the markings rather more abundant towards
the larger end. As an article of food, they are excellent. These
gulls are extremely anxious about their eggs, as well as their young, which
are apt to wander away from the nest while yet quite small. They are
able to fly at the end of six weeks, and soon after this are abandoned
by their parents, when the old and young birds keep apart in flocks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
until the following spring, when, I think, the latter nearly attain the
plumage of their parents, though they are still smaller, and have the
terminal band on the tail.
</p>

<p>
The Black-headed Gull frequently associates with the Razor-billed
Shearwater, <i>Rhynchops nigra</i>, in winter; and I can safely say that I
have seen more than a thousand of each kind alight on the same points
of estuaries and mouths of rivers; the Gulls standing or sitting by themselves,
at no great distance from the Razor-bills. Now and then they
would all suddenly rise on wing as if frightened, perform a few evolutions
in the air, and again settle on the very same spot, still, however,
keeping separate. While thus in the company of the Razor-bills, the
Gulls are with great difficulty approached, the former being exceedingly
wary, and almost always rising when a person draws near, the
Gulls immediately following them, and the two great flocks making off
to some distant point, generally not very accessible. If taken up on
being wounded, these gulls are apt to bite severely. If, on being shot
at, they fall on the water, they swim fast and lightly, their companions
all the while soaring above, and plunging towards them, as if intent on
rescuing them. This great sympathy often proves fatal to them, for,
if the gunner is inclined, he may shoot them down without any difficulty,
and the more he kills the more his chances are increased.
</p>

<p>
On the 10th of May 1832, it was my good fortune to be snugly on
board the “Lady of the Green Mantle,” or, in other words, the fine
revenue cutter the Marion. The Gulls that laughed whilst our anchors
were swiftly descending towards the marvellous productions of the
deep, soon had occasion to be sorrowful enough. As they were in
great numbers, officers and men, as well as the American Woodsman,
gazing upon them from the high decks of the gallant bark, had ample
opportunities of observing their motions. They were all busily engaged
on wing, hovering here and there around the Brown Pelicans,
intent on watching their plunges into the water, and all clamorously
teasing their best benefactors. As with broadly extended pouch and
lower mandible, the Pelican went down headlong, so gracefully followed
the gay rosy-breasted Gull, which, on the brown bird’s emerging,
alighted nimbly on its very head, and with a gentle stoop instantly
snatched from the mouth of its purveyor the glittering fry that
moment entrapped!
</p>

<p>
Is this not quite strange, Reader? Aye, truly it is. The sight of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
these manœuvres rendered me almost frantic with delight. At times,
several gulls would attempt to alight on the head of the same Pelican,
but finding this impossible, they would at once sustain themselves
around it, and snatch every morsel that escaped from the pouch of the
great bird. So very dexterous were some of the Gulls at this sport,
that I have seen them actually catch a little fish as it leaped from
the yet partially open bill of the Pelican. And now, Reader, I will
conclude this long article with some fragments from my journals.
</p>

<p>
Tortugas, May 1832.—Whilst here, I often saw the Black-headed
Gull of Wilson, sucking the eggs of <i>Sterna fuliginosa</i>, and <i>Sterna stolida</i>.
Our sailors assured me that these gulls also eat the young of these two
species of Terns when newly hatched.
</p>

<p>
Great Egg Harbour, May 1829.—Like all other gulls, the <i>Larus
Atricilla</i> disgorges its food when attacked by a Lestris, or when wounded,
or suddenly surprised; but on all occasions of respite this gull is apt
to return to it, and vulture-like to swallow it anew. It differs however
from the larger species of gulls, by never, as far as I have observed,
picking up bivalve shells, for the purpose of letting them fall
to break them, and afterwards feed on their contents.  On the
ground they walk with considerable alertness, and not without a certain
degree of elegance, especially during the love season. Whilst
floating or swimming on the water, they are graceful in a high degree,
and when seen, as they oftentimes are, in groups of many pairs, rising
with, or sinking amidst the billows, which ever and anon break on the
sandy shores of the coast, their alternate appearance brings to the
mind of the bystander ideas connected with objects altogether different
from the simple yet beautiful Laughing Gull.
</p>

<p>
April 1, 1837.—South-west pass of the Mississippi. <i>L. Atricilla</i>
abundant here at this season, as well as at New Orleans. Saw some
floating on logs during a heavy breeze. Not noisy yet, though they
and <i>L. zonorhynchus</i> are in full spring dress (the old birds).
</p>

<p>
Barataria Bay, April 1837.—This species is abundant, following
the porpoises, whilst the latter are fishing, and attending on them, as
they do on the Brown Pelicans, which I saw here tormented by these
birds, as in the Floridas. These Gulls follow the Brown Pelicans
to their roosts, and along with them sit on grounded logs, at some distance
from the shores, to avoid the attacks of racoons and other carnivorous
animals.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Galveston Bay, April 26, 1837.—Black-headed Gulls are not unfrequently
seen hovering over the inner ponds of these islands, as if in
search of food. They are now all paired, and very noisy.
</p>

<p>
May 4.—I observed to-day that at the single cry of a Black-headed
Gull, all others within hearing at once came towards the caller,
and this never failed when any of them had found floating garbage on
which to feed. These, as well as all other gulls, pat the water with
their feet, their legs being partially extended, whilst assisting themselves
with the bill to pick up any floating food. At this time the
whole group emit a more plaintive single note than usual. They come
not unfrequently within a few yards of our vessel at anchor, and when
the food thrown to them is exhausted, they separate, and at once renew
their repeated cries. I observed that the few immature birds among
the old ones, were quite silent even when in the company of the adults.
When the young are nearly able to fly, they are by no means bad eating.

<h2>
KNOT OR ASH-COLOURED SANDPIPER.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tringa islandica</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXV. Adult in Summer and Winter.</span>
</p>


<p>
The Knot, good Reader, is a handsome and interesting species,
whether in its spring or in its winter plumage, and, provided it be young
and fat, is always welcome to the palate of the connoisseur in dainties.
As to its habits, however, during the breeding season, I am sorry to
inform you that I know nothing at all, for in Labrador, whither I went
to examine them, I did not find a single individual. I have been informed
that several students of nature have visited its breeding places;
but why they have given us no information on the subject, seeing that
not only you and I, but many persons besides, would be glad to hear
about it, is what we cannot account for.
</p>

<p>
I do not wish you to infer from these remarks, that the persons
alluded to are the only ones who have neglected to note down on
the spot observations which might be interesting and useful. I myself
am very conscious of my own remissness in this respect, and deeply
regret the many opportunities of studying nature which have been
in a manner lost to me, on account of a temporary supineness which
has seized upon me, at the very moment when the objects of my pursuit
were placed within my reach by that bountiful Being to whom we
owe all our earthly enjoyments, and all our hopes of that future happiness
which we strive to merit.
</p>

<p>
I have traced the Knot along the shores of our Atlantic states, from
Texas to the entrance of the Bay of Fundy, in the months of April
and May, and again in the autumnal months. I have also found it in
winter in East Florida, and therefore feel confident that some of the
species do not proceed beyond our southern limits at that season.
Whilst on the Bay of Galveston, in Texas, in April 1837, I daily observed
groups of Knots arriving there, and proceeding eastward, meandering
along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In the interior of the
United States I never observed one, and for this reason I am inclined
to think that the species moves northward along the coast. But
as I did not find any in Nova Scotia, Labrador, or Newfoundland, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
consider it probable that those which betake themselves to the fur countries,
turn off from our Atlantic shores when they have reached the entrance
of the Bay of Fundy. However this may be, it is certain that
they reach a very high latitude, and that some stop to breed about Hudson’s
Bay, where Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> found them in summer.
</p>

<p>
On some few occasions I have observed the Knot associating with
the Tell-tale Godwit and Semi-palmated Snipe, about a mile from the
sea, along the margins of ponds of brackish-water; but such localities
seemed in a manner unnatural to them, and it was seldom that more
than two or three were seen there. Along the shores, in spring, I have
not unfrequently thought that they seemed dull, as if they had lost
themselves, for they would allow a person to go very near, and seldom
took to wing unless induced to do so by companions of other species,
who were better aware of their situation. In autumn, when they
at times collect into very large flocks, I have often followed them until
I obtained as many as I wished. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> has so beautifully described
their movements at such times, that, although I have often witnessed
them myself, I prefer giving his own words.
</p>

<p>
“In activity it is superior to the Turnstone; and traces the flowing
and recession of the waves along the sandy beach with great nimbleness,
wading and searching among the loosened particles for its favourite
food, which is a small thin oval bivalve shell-fish, of a white or
pearl-colour, and not larger than the seed of an apple. These usually
lie at a short distance below the surface; but in some places are
seen at low water in heaps, like masses of wet grain, in quantities of
more than a bushel together. During the latter part of summer and
autumn, these minute shell-fish constitute the food of almost all those
busy flocks that run with such activity along the sands, among the flowing
and retreating waves. They are universally swallowed whole; but
the action of the bird’s stomach, assisted by the shells themselves, soon
reduces them to a pulp. Digging for these in the hard sand would
be a work of considerable labour, whereas, when the particles are
loosened by the flowing of the sea, the birds collect them with great
ease and dexterity. It is amusing to observe with what adroitness they
follow and elude the tumbling surf, while at the same time they seem
wholly intent on collecting their food.”
</p>

<p>
I have however seen the Knot probe the wet sands, on the borders
of oozy salt marshes, thrusting in its bill to the feathers on the forehead,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
and this with the same dexterity as several other species. Its flight is
swift, at times rather elevated, and well sustained. At their first arrival
in autumn, when they are occasionally seen in great numbers in
the same flock, their aërial evolutions are very beautiful, for, like our
Parrakeet, Passenger Pigeon, Rice-bird, Red-winged Starling, and other
birds, they follow each other in their course, with a celerity that seems
almost incomprehensible, when the individuals are so near each other that
one might suppose it impossible for them to turn and wheel without interfering
with each other. At such times, their lower and upper parts are
alternately seen, the flock exhibiting now a dusky appearance, and again
gleaming like a meteor.
</p>

<p>
Many of these young birds continue mottled with dull reddish-orange
on their lower parts until the winter is far advanced. The old
individuals have their whole upper plumage of a uniform grey, and their
lower parts white. As those of the first year have their markings at
that season handsomer than at any other period of their lives, I have
given the figure of one in preference to that of an adult.
</p>

<p>
It has been supposed by some that two different species of Knot
occur in the United States, but I am of a different opinion. The dimensions
of birds of this family, as well as of many others, are extremely
variable; and, on shooting eight or ten Knots, it would be difficult to
find two of them having exactly the same size and proportions. If I
add to this the very remarkable changes of plumage exhibited by birds
of this family before and after maturity, you will not think it strange
that <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> should have mistaken the young of the Knot for a separate
species from the old bird in its spring dress. Indeed, I am obliged
to tell you that I have been much puzzled, when, on picking up several
of these birds from the same flock, I have found some having longer and
thicker bills than others, with as strange a difference in the size of their
eyes. These differences I have endeavoured to represent in my plate.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> states, that this species is quite abundant
in South Carolina, in its autumn and spring migrations, but that
he has never seen it there in full plumage. In that country it is
called the “May Bird,” which, however, is a name also given to the
Rice Bird. Along the coasts of our Middle District, it is usually known
by the name of “Grey-back.”

Reader, the pleasures which I have experienced in the course of
this chequered life of mine have been many;—perhaps many more than
would have fallen to my share, had I not, fortunately for me, become
a devoted and enthusiastic lover of Nature’s beauteous and wondrous
works, which, in truth, I have been from the earliest period to which
my recollection extends; and those who have known me best will not for
a moment consider it extravagant in me to say, that among the greatest
pleasures I have known, has been that derived from pursuing and faithfully
describing such of our American birds as were previously unknown or
but little observed. Many sultry summer days I have passed amidst the
most dismal swamps of the secluded woods of Louisiana, watching with
anxiety and in silence the curious habits of the Anhinga; the female bird
now sitting closely on her eggs, in a nest constructed by herself and securely
placed on the widely extended branch of the tallest cypress, that,
as if by magic planted, stood in the midst of an ample lake, while with
keen eyes she watched every motion of the wily Buzzard and cunning
Crow, lest either of these cowardly marauders might deprive her of
her treasures; the partner of her cares and joys meanwhile, with outspread
wings and fan-like tail, soaring on high, and glancing first anxiously
towards her he loves, then in anger towards one and all of their
numerous enemies. In wider and bolder circles he moves, rising higher
and still higher, until at length, becoming a mere dusky speck, he almost
vanishes from my sight amidst the expanse of the blue sky; but
now, suddenly closing his wings, and rushing downwards like a meteor,
I see him instantly alight erect upon the edge of the nest, and complacently
gaze upon his beloved.
</p>

<p>
After some time, about three weeks perhaps, I have found the eggshells
beneath the great cypress tree, cast out of the nest by the intelligent
and attentive mother, and floating on the green slime of the stagnant
pool. Climbing to the nest itself, I have seen the tender young clad in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
down far softer than our sea-island cottons, writhing their slender and tremulous
necks, and with open mouths and extended pouches seeking, as
all infants are wont to seek, the food suited to their delicate frame.
Then, retiring to some concealed spot, I have seen the mother arrive
with a supply of finely masticated nutriment, compounded of various
fishes from the lake, and furnish each of her progeny by regurgitation
with its due proportion. Thus, also, I have watched the growth of the
younglings, marking their daily progress, which varied according to the
changes of temperature and the state of the atmosphere. At length, after
waiting many days in succession, I have seen them stand, in an almost
erect posture, on a space scarcely large enough to contain them. The
parents seemed aware of the condition of their brood, and, affectionate
as they still appeared to be, I thought their manner towards them was
altered, and I felt grieved. Indeed, sorely grieved I was when, next
week, I saw them discharge, as it were, their children, and force them
from the nest into the waters that were spread below. It is true that,
previous to this, I had seen the young Anhingas trying the power of
their wings as they stood upright on the nest, flapping them many minutes
at a time; yet, although thus convinced that they were nearly
in a state to provide for themselves, it was not without a feeling of despondency
that I saw them hurled into the air, and alight on the water.
But, Reader, Nature in all this had acted beneficially; and I afterwards
found that in thus expelling their young so soon, the old birds had in
view to rear another brood in the same spot, before the commencement
of unfavourable weather.
</p>

<p>
Many writers have described what they have been pleased to call
the habits of the Anhinga; nay, some have presumed to offer comments
upon them, and to generalize and form theories thereon, or even
to inform us gravely and oracularly what they ought to be, when the
basis of all their fancies was merely a dried skin and feathers appended.
Leaving these ornithologists for the present to amuse themselves in
their snug closets, I proceed to detail the real habits of this curious
bird, as I have observed and studied them in Nature.
</p>

<p>
The Snake-Bird is a constant resident in the Floridas, and the lower
parts of Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia. Few remain during winter
in South Carolina, or in any district to the eastward of that State; but
some proceed as far as North Carolina in spring, and breed along the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
coast, I have found it in Texas in the month of May, on the waters
of Buffalo Bayou, and the St Jacinto River, where it breeds, and
where, as I was told, it spends the winter. It rarely ascends the Mississippi
beyond the neighbourhood of Natchez, from which most of the
individuals return to the mouths of that great stream, and the numerous
lakes, ponds, and bayous in its vicinity, where I have observed the
species at all seasons, as well as in the Floridas.
</p>

<p>
Being a bird which, by its habits, rarely fails to attract the notice
of the most indifferent observer, it has received various names. The
Creoles of Louisiana, about New Orleans, and as far up the Mississippi
as Pointe Coup, call it “Bec à Lancette,” on account of the form of its
bill; whilst at the mouths of the river it bears the name of “Water
Crow.” In the southern parts of Florida, it is called the “Grecian
Lady,” and in South Carolina it is best known by the name of “Cormorant.”
Yet in all these parts, it bears also the name of “Snake-Bird;”
but it is nowhere with us called the “Black-bellied Darter,”
which, by the way, could only be with strict propriety applied to the
adult male.
</p>

<p>
Those which, on the one hand, ascend the Mississippi, and, on the
other, visit the Carolinas, arrive at their several places of resort early
in April, in some seasons even in March, and there remain until the
beginning of November. Although this bird is occasionally seen in
the immediate vicinity of the sea, and at times breeds not far from it,
I never met with an individual fishing in salt water. It gives a decided
preference to rivers, lakes, bayous, or lagoons in the interior, always
however in the lowest and most level parts of the country. The
more retired and secluded the spot, the more willingly does the Snake-Bird
remain about it. Sometimes indeed I have suddenly come on
some in such small ponds, which I discovered by mere accident, and
in parts of woods so very secluded, that I was taken by surprise on
seeing them. The Floridas therefore are peculiarly adapted for this
species, as there the torpid waters of the streams, bayous, and lakes,
are most abundantly supplied with various species of fish, reptiles, and
insects, while the temperature is at all seasons congenial, and their
exemption from annoyance almost unparalleled. Wherever similar
situations occur in other parts of the Southern States, there the Anhingas
are met with in numbers proportioned to the extent of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
favourable localities. It is very seldom indeed that any are seen on
rapid streams, and more especially on clear water, a single instance of
such an occurrence being all that I have observed. Wherever you
may chance to find this bird, you will perceive that it has not left itself
without the means of escape; you will never find one in a pond or
bayou completely enclosed by tall trees, so as to obstruct its passage;
but will observe that it generally prefers ponds or lakes, surrounded by
deep and almost impenetrable morasses, and having a few large trees
growing out of the water near their centre, from the branches of which
they can easily mark the approach of an enemy, and make their escape
in good time. Unlike the Fish-hawk and Kings-fisher, the Anhinga
however never plunges or dives from an eminence in procuring its
prey, although from its habit of occasionally dropping in silence to the
water from its perch, for the purpose of afterwards swimming about and
diving in the manner of the Cormorant, some writers have been led to
believe that it does so.
</p>

<p>
The Black-bellied Darter, all whose names I shall use, for the purpose
of avoiding irksome repetitions, may be considered as indefinitely
gregarious; by which I mean that you may see eight or more together
at times, during winter especially, or only two, as in the breeding season.
On a few occasions, whilst in the interior of the southernmost
parts of Florida, I saw about thirty individuals on the same lake.
While exploring the St John’s River of that country in its whole length,
I sometimes saw several hundreds together. I procured a great number
on that stream, on the lakes in its neighbourhood, and also on
those near the plantation of Mr <span class="smcap">Bulow</span>, on the eastern side of the Peninsula.
I observed that the young Darters, as well as those of the
Cormorants, Herons, and many other birds, kept apart from the old
individuals, which they however joined in spring, when they had attained
their full beauty of plumage.
</p>

<p>
The Anhinga is altogether a diurnal bird, and, like the Cormorant,
is fond of returning to the same roosting place every evening about dusk,
unless prevented by molestation. At times I have seen from three to
seven alight on the dead top branches of a tall tree, for the purpose
of there spending the night; and this they repeated for several weeks,
until on my having killed some of them and wounded others, the rest
abandoned the spot, and after several furious contests with a party that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
roosted about two miles off, succeeding in establishing themselves
among them. At such times they seldom sit very near each other, as
Cormorants do, but keep at a distance of a few feet or yards, according
to the nature of the branches. Whilst asleep, they stand with the
body almost erect, but never bend the tarsus so as to apply it in its
whole length, as the Cormorant does; they keep their head snugly
covered among their scapulars, and at times emit a wheezing sound,
which I supposed to be produced by their breathing. In rainy weather
they often remain roosted the greater part of the day, and on such
occasions they stand erect, with their neck and head stretched upwards,
remaining perfectly motionless, as if to allow the water to glide
off their plumage. Now and then, however, they suddenly ruffle their
feathers, violently shake themselves, and again compressing their form,
resume their singular position.
</p>

<p>
Their disposition to return to the same roosting places is so decided
that, when chased from their places of resort, they seldom fail to betake
themselves to them during the day; and in this manner they
may easily be procured with some care. Whilst at Mr <span class="smcap">Bulow</span>’s, I
was almost daily in the habit of visiting a long, tortuous, bayou, many
miles in extent, which at that season (winter) was abundantly supplied
with Anhingas. There the Otter, the Alligator, and many species
of birds, found an ample supply of food; and as I was constantly
watching them, I soon discovered a roosting place of the Snake-Birds,
which was a large dead tree. I found it impossible to get near them
either by cautiously advancing in the boat, or by creeping among the
briars, canes, and tangled palmettoes which profusely covered the
banks.  I therefore paddled directly to the place, accompanied by
my faithful and sagacious Newfoundland dog. At my approach the
birds flew off towards the upper parts of the stream, and as I knew that
they might remain for hours, I had a boat sent after them with orders
to the Negroes to start all that they could see. Dragging up my little
bark, I then hid myself among the tangled plants, and, with my eyes
bent on the dead tree, and my gun in readiness, I remained until I saw
the beautiful bird alight and gaze around to see if all was right. Alas!
it was not aware of its danger, but, after a few moments, during which
I noted its curious motions, it fell dead into the water, while the reverberations
consequent on the discharge of my gun alarmed the birds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
around, and by looking either up or down the bayou I could see many
Anhingas speeding away to other parts. My dog, as obedient as the
most submissive of servants, never stirred until ordered, when he would
walk cautiously into the water, swim up to the dead bird, and having
brought it to me, lie down gently in his place. In this manner, in the
course of one day I procured fourteen of these birds, and wounded several
others. I may here at once tell you that all the roosting places
of the Anhinga which I have seen were over the water, either on the
shore or in the midst of some stagnant pool; and this situation they
seem to select because there they can enjoy the first gladdening rays
of the morning sun, or bask in the blaze of its noontide splendour, and
also observe with greater ease the approach of their enemies, as they
betake themselves to it after feeding, and remain there until hunger
urges them to fly off. There, trusting to the extraordinary keenness
of their beautiful bright eyes in spying the marauding sons of the forest,
or the not less dangerous enthusiast, who, probably like yourself, would
venture through mud and slime up to his very neck, to get within rifle
shot of a bird so remarkable in form and manners, the Anhingas, or
“Grecian Ladies,” stand erect, with their wings and tail fully or partially
spread out in the sunshine, whilst their long slender necks and
heads are thrown as it were in every direction by the most curious
and sudden jerks and bendings. Their bills are open, and you see that
the intense heat of the atmosphere induces them to suffer their gular
pouch to hang loosely. What delightful sights and scenes these have
been to me, good Reader! With what anxiety have I waded toward
these birds, to watch their movements, while at the same time I cooled
my over-heated body, and left behind on the shores myriads of hungry
sand-flies, gnats, mosquitoes, and ticks, that had annoyed me for hours!
And oh! how great has been my pleasure when, after several failures,
I have at last picked up the spotted bird, examined it with care, and
then returned to the gloomy shore, to note my observations! Great too
is my pleasure in now relating to you the results of my long personal
experience, together with that of my excellent friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>,
who has transmitted his observations on this bird to me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, I am inclined to think, never saw a live Anhinga; and
the notes, furnished by Mr <span class="smcap">Abbot</span> of Georgia, which he has published,
are very far from being correct. In the supplementary volumes of
American Ornithology published in Philadelphia, the Editor, who visited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
the Floridas; added nothing of importance beyond giving more accurate
measurements of a single specimen than <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> had given from
the stuffed skins from which he made his figures, and which were in
the museum of that city.
</p>

<p>
The peculiar form, long wings, and large fan-like tail of the Anhinga,
would at once induce a person looking upon it to conclude that
it was intended by nature rather for protracted and powerful flight, than
for spending as it does more than half of its time by day in the water,
where its progress, one might suppose, would be greatly impeded by
the amplitude of these parts. Yet how different from such a supposition
is the fact? The Anhinga in truth is the very first of all fresh-water
divers. With the quickness of thought it disappears beneath
the surface, and that so as scarcely to leave a ripple on the spot; and
when your anxious eyes seek around for the bird, you are astonished
to find it many hundred yards distant, the head perhaps merely above
water for a moment; or you may chance to perceive the bill alone
gently cutting the water, and producing a line of wake not observable
beyond the distance of thirty yards from where you are standing. With
habits like these it easily eludes all your efforts to procure it. When
shot at while perched, however severely wounded they may be, they
fall at once perpendicularly, the bill downward, the wings and tail
closed, and then dive and make their way under water to such a distance
that they are rarely obtained. Should you, however, see them again,
and set out in pursuit, they dive along the shores, attach themselves to
roots of trees or plants by the feet, and so remain until life is extinct.
When shot dead on the trees, they sometimes cling so firmly to the
branches that you must wait some minutes before they fall.
</p>

<p>
The generally received opinion or belief that the Anhinga always
swims with its body sunk beneath the surface is quite incorrect; for it
does so only when in sight of an enemy, and when under no apprehension
of danger it is as buoyant as any other diving bird, such as a Cormorant,
a Merganser, a Grebe, or a Diver. This erroneous opinion
has, however, been adopted simply because few persons have watched
the bird with sufficient care. When it first observes an enemy, it immediately
sinks its body deeper, in the manner of the birds just mentioned,
and the nearer the danger approaches, the more does it sink,
until at last it swims off with the head and neck only above the surface,
when these parts, from their form and peculiar sinuous motion,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
somewhat resemble the head and part of the body of a snake. It is in
fact from this circumstance that the Anhinga has received the name of
Snake-Bird. At such a time, it is seen constantly turning its head from
side to side, often opening its bill as if for the purpose of inhaling a
larger quantity of air, to enable it the better to dive, and remain under
water so long that when it next makes its appearance it is out of your
reach. When fishing in a state of security it dives precisely like a
Cormorant, returns to the surface as soon as it has procured a fish or
other article of food, shakes it, if it is not too large often throws it up
into the air, and receiving it conveniently in the bill, swallows it at
once, and recommences its search. But I doubt much if it ever seizes
on any thing that it cannot thus swallow whole. They have the curious
habit of diving under any floating substances, such as parcels of dead
weeds or leaves of trees which have accidentally been accumulated by
the winds or currents, or even the green slimy substances produced by
putrefaction. This habit is continued by the species when in a perfect
state of domestication, for I have seen one kept by my friend <span class="smcap">John
Bachman</span> thus diving when within a few feet of a quantity of floating
rice-chaff, in one of the tide-ponds in the neighbourhood of Charleston.
Like the Common Goose, it invariably depresses its head while swimming
under a low bridge, or a branch or trunk of a tree hanging over
the water. When it swims beneath the surface of the water, it spreads
its wings partially, but does not employ them as a means of propulsion,
and keeps its tail always considerably expanded, using the feet as
paddles either simultaneously, or alternately.
</p>

<p>
The quantity of fish consumed by this bird is astonishing; and
what I am about to relate on this subject will appear equally so. One
morning Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> and I gave to an Anhinga a Black Fish, measuring
nine and a half inches, by two inches in diameter; and although
the head of the fish was considerably larger than its body, and its
strong and spinous fins appeared formidable, the bird, which was then
about seven months old, swallowed it entire, head foremost. It was
in appearance digested in an hour and a half, when the bird swallowed
three others of somewhat smaller size. At another time, we placed
before it a number of fishes about seven and a half inches long, of which
it swallowed nine in succession. It would devour at a meal forty or
more fishes about three inches and a half long. On several occasions
it was fed on Plaice, when it swallowed some that were four inches
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
broad, extending its throat, and compressing them during their descent
into the stomach. It did not appear to relish eels, as it eat all the
other sorts first, and kept them to the last; and after having swallowed
them, it had great difficulty in keeping them down, but, although for
a while thwarted, it would renew its efforts, and at length master them.
When taken to the tide-pond at the foot of my friend’s garden, it would
now and then after diving return to the surface of the water with a
cray-fish in its mouth, which it pressed hard and dashed about in its bill,
evidently for the purpose of maiming it, before it would attempt to
swallow it, and it never caught a fish without bringing it up to subject
it to the same operation.
</p>

<p>
While residing near Bayou Sara, in the State of Mississippi, I was
in the habit of occasionally visiting some acquaintances residing at
Pointe Coup, nearly opposite the mouth of the bayou. One day, on
entering the house of an humble settler close on the western bank of
the Mississippi, I observed two young Anhingas that had been taken
out of a nest containing four, which had been built on a high cypress
in a lake on the eastern side of the river. They were perfectly tame
and gentle, and much attached to their foster-parents, the man and
woman of the house, whom they followed wherever they went. They
fed with equal willingness on shrimps and fish, and when neither could
be had, contented themselves with boiled Indian corn, of which they
caught with great ease the grains as they were thrown one by one to
them. I was afterwards informed, that when a year old, they were
allowed to go to the river and fish for themselves, or to the ponds on
either side, and that they regularly returned towards night for the purpose
of roosting on the top of the house. Both birds were males, and
in time they fought hard battles, but at last each met with a female,
which it enticed to the roost on the house-top, where all the four slept
at night for a while. Soon after, the females having probably laid their
eggs in the woods, they all disappeared, and were never again seen by
the persons who related this curious affair.
</p>

<p>
The Anhinga is shy and wary when residing in a densely peopled
part of the country, which, however, is rarely the case, as I
have already mentioned; but when in its favourite secluded and
peaceful haunts, where it has seldom or never been molested, it is
easily approached and without difficulty procured; nay, sometimes one
will remain standing in the same spot and in the same posture, until
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
you have fired several bullets from your rifle at it. Its mode of
fishing is not to plunge from a tree or stump in pursuit of its prey, but
to dive while swimming in the manner of Cormorants and many other
birds. Indeed, it could very seldom see a fish from above the surface
of the turbid waters which it prefers.
</p>

<p>
It moves along the branches of trees rather awkwardly; but still it
walks there, with the aid of its wings, which it extends for that purpose,
and not unfrequently also using its bill in the manner of a Parrot.
On the land, it walks and even runs with considerable ease, certainly
with more expertness than the Cormorant, though much in the
same style. But it does not employ its tail to aid it, for, on the contrary,
it carries that organ inclined upwards, and during its progress
from one place to another, the movements of its head and neck are continued.
These movements, which, as I have said, resemble sudden
jerkings of the parts to their full extent, become extremely graceful
during the love season, when they are reduced to gentle curvatures.
I must not forget to say, that during all these movements, the gular
pouch is distended, and the bird emits rough guttural sounds. If they
are courting on wing, however, in the manner of Cormorants, Hawks,
and many other birds, they emit a whistling note, somewhat resembling
that of some of our rapacious birds, and which may be expressed by
the syllables <i>eek</i>, <i>eek</i>, <i>eek</i>, the first loudest, and the rest diminishing in
strength. When they are on the water, their call-notes so much resemble
the rough grunting cries the Florida Cormorant, that I have
often mistaken them for the latter.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Anhinga is swift, and at times well sustained;
but like the Cormorants, it has the habit of spreading its wings and
tail before it leaves its perch or the surface of the water, thus frequently
affording the sportsman a good opportunity of shooting it. When once
on wing, they can rise to a vast height, in beautiful gyrations, varied
during the love-season by zigzag lines chiefly performed by the male,
as he plays around his beloved. At times they quite disappear from
the gaze, lost as it were, in the upper regions of the air; and at other
times, when much lower, seem to remain suspended in the same spot
for several seconds. All this while, and indeed as long as they are
flying, their wings are directly extended, their neck stretched to its
full length, their tail more or less spread according to the movements
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
to be performed, being closed when they descend, expanded and declined
to either side when they mount. During their migratory expeditions,
they beat their wings at times in the manner of the Cormorant,
and at other times sail like the Turkey Buzzard and some Hawks,
the former mode being more frequently observed when they are passing
over an extent of woodland, the latter when over a sheet of water. If
disturbed or alarmed, they fly with continuous beats of the wings, and
proceed with great velocity. As they find difficulty in leaving their
perch without previously expanding their wings, they are also, when
about to alight, obliged to use them in supporting their body, until
their feet have taken a sufficient hold of the branch on which they desire
to settle. In this respect, they exactly resemble the Florida Cormorant.
</p>

<p>
There are facts connected with the habits of birds which might afford
a pretty good idea of the relative temperatures of different parts
of the country during a given season; and those observed with regard
to the Anhinga seem to me peculiarly illustrative of this circumstance.
I have found the “Grecian Lady” breeding on St John’s River in East
Florida, near Lake George, as early as the 23d of February; having
previously seen many of them caressing each other on the waters, and
again carrying sticks, fresh twigs, and other matters, to form their nests,
and having also shot females with the eggs largely developed. Now,
at the same period, perhaps not a single Anhinga is to be seen in the
neighbourhood of Natchez, only a few about New Orleans, in the eastern
parts of Georgia, and the middle maritime portions of South Carolina.
In Louisiana this bird breeds in April or May, and in South
Carolina rarely before June, my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> having found eggs,
and young just hatched, as late as the 28th of that month. In North
Carolina, where only a few pairs breed, it is later by a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
I have already expressed my opinion that birds which thus breed
so much earlier in one section of the country than in another, especially
when at great distances, may, after producing one or even two
broods, in the same year, still have time enough to proceed toward higher
latitudes for the purpose of again breeding. Actual observations have
moreover satisfied me that individuals of the same species produced in
warm latitudes have a stronger disposition toward reproduction than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
those of more northern climates. This being the case, and most birds
endowed with the power of migrating, having a tendency to exercise
it, may we not suppose that the pair of Anhingas which bred on the St
John’s in February, might be inclined to breed again either in South
Carolina or in the neighbourhood of Natchez, several months after.
But, as yet, I have not been able to adduce positive proof of the accuracy
of this opinion.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Snake-bird is variously placed in different localities;
sometimes in low bushes, and even on the common smilax, not more
than eight or ten feet above the water, if the place be secluded, or on
the lower or top branches of the highest trees, but always over the
water. In Louisiana and the State of Mississippi, where I have seen a
goodly number of nests, they were generally placed on very large and
tall cypresses, growing out of the central parts of lakes and ponds, or
overhanging the borders of lagoons, bayous, or rivers, distant from
inhabited places. They are frequently placed singly, but at times
amidst hundreds or even thousands of nests of several species of Herons,
especially <i>Ardea alba</i> and <i>A. Herodias</i>, the Great White and
Great Blue Herons. As however in all cases the form, size, and component
materials are nearly the same, I will here describe a nest procured
for the purpose by my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>.
</p>

<p>
It measured fully two feet in diameter, and was of a flattened form,
much resembling that of the Florida Cormorant. The first or bottom
layer was made of dry sticks of different sizes, some nearly half an inch
in diameter, laid crosswise, but in a circular manner. Green branches
with leaves on them, of the common myrtle, <i>Myrica cerifera</i>, a quantity
of Spanish moss, and some slender roots, formed the upper and inside
layer, which was as solid and compact as that of any nest of the
Heron tribe. This nest contained four eggs; another examined on
the same day had four young birds; a third only three; and in no instance
has a nest of the Anhinga been found with either eight eggs,
or “two eggs and six young ones,” as mentioned by Mr <span class="smcap">Abbott</span>, of
Georgia, in his notes transmitted to <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>. Mr <span class="smcap">Abbott</span> is however
correct in saying that this species “will occupy the same tree for a series
of years,” and I have myself known a pair to breed in the same
nest three seasons, augmenting and repairing it every succeeding
spring, as Cormorants and Herons are wont to do. The eggs average
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
two inches and five-eighths in length, by one and a quarter in diameter,
and are of an elongated oval form, of a dull uniform whitish colour
externally, being covered with a chalky substance, beneath which the
shell, on being carefully scraped, is of a light blue, precisely resembling
in this respect the eggs of the different species of American Cormorants
with which I am acquainted.
</p>

<p>
The young when about a fortnight old are clad with a uniform
buff-coloured down; their bill is black, their feet yellowish-white, their
head and neck nearly naked; and now they resemble young Cormorants,
though of a different colour. The wing feathers make their appearance
through the down, and are dark brown. The birds in the same nest
differ as much in size as those of Cormorants, the largest being almost
twice the size of the smallest. At this age they are in the habit of raising
themselves by placing their bills on the upper part of the nest, or over
a branch if convenient, and drawing themselves up by their jaws, which
on such occasions they open very widely. This habit is continued by
young birds whilst in confinement, and was also observed in the Cormorant,
<i>Phalacrocorax Carbo</i>, the young of which assisted themselves
with their bills while crawling about on the deck of the Ripley. The
action is indeed performed by the Anhinga at all periods of its life.
At an early age the young utter a low wheezing call, and at times some
cries resembling those of the young of the smaller species of Herons.
From birth they are fed by regurgitation, which one might suppose an
irksome task to the parent birds, as during the act they open their
wings and raise their tails. I have not been able to ascertain the period
of incubation, but am sure that the male and the female sit alternately,
the latter however remaining much longer on the nest. Young
Anhingas when approached while in the nest cling tenaciously to it,
until seized, and if thrown down, they merely float on the water, and
are easily captured. On the contrary, the young Florida Cormorants
throw themselves into the water, and dive at once.
</p>

<p>
When they are three weeks old, the quills and tail-feathers grow
rapidly, but continue of the same dark-brown colour, and so remain
until they are able to fly, when they leave the nest, although they still
present a singular motley appearance, the breast and back being buff-coloured,
while the wings and tail are nearly black. After the feathers
of the wings and tail are nearly fully developed, those of the sides of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
the body and breast become visible through the down, and the bird
appears more curiously mottled than before. The young male now assumes
the colour of the adult female, which it retains until the beginning
of October, when the breast becomes streaked with dusky; white
spots shew themselves on the back, the black of which becomes more
intense, and the crimpings on the two middle feathers of the tail, which
have been more or less apparent from the first, are now perfect. By
the middle of February, the male is in full plumage, but the eyes have
not yet acquired their full colour, being only of a dull reddish-orange.
In this respect also two differences are observed between the Anhinga
and the Cormorants. The first is the rapid progress of the Anhinga
towards maturity of plumage, the other the retaining of its complete
dress through the whole of its life, no change taking place in its colours
at each successive moult. The Cormorants, on the contrary, take
three or four years to attain their full dress of the love season, which
lasts only during that period of excitement. The progress of the plumage
in the female Anhinga is as rapid as in the male, and the tints
also remain unaltered through each successive moult.
</p>

<p>
Like all other carnivorous and piscivorous birds, the Anhinga can
remain days and nights without food, apparently without being much
incommoded. When overtaken on being wounded, and especially if
brought to the ground, it seems to regard its enemies without fear.
On several occasions of this kind, I have seen it watch my approach,
or that of my dog, standing as erect as it could under the pain of its
wounds, with its head drawn back, its bill open, and its throat swelled
with anger until, when at a sure distance, it would dart its head forward
and give a severe wound. One which had thus struck at my dog’s
nose, hung to it until dragged to my feet over a space of thirty paces.
When seized by the neck, they scratch severely with their sharp claws,
and beat their wings about you with much more vigour than you would
suppose they could possess.  Having witnessed the singular means
employed by this bird in making its escape on sudden emergencies, I
will here relate an instance, which evinces a kind of reason. Whilst
ascending the St John’s river in East Florida, along with Captain
<span class="smcap">Piercy</span> of the U. S. Navy, our boat was rowed into a circular basin of
clear shallow water, having a sandy bottom; such places being found
occasionally in that country, produced by the flowing of springs from
the more elevated sandy parts into the muddy rivers and lakes. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
entered the cove by passing between the branches of low trees, overhung
by others of great height. The first object that attracted my
attention was a female Anhinga perched on the opposite side of the
cove, and, as I did not wish that it should be shot, we merely advanced
towards it, when it began to throw its head about, and watch our
motions. The place was small, and the enclosing trees high. Though
it might have flown upwards and escaped, it remained perched, but
evidently perturbed and apprehensive of danger. When the boat was
at a short distance, however, it suddenly threw itself backward, cutting
a somerset as it were, and, covered by the branches, darted straight
through the tangled forest, and was soon out of sight. Never before
nor since have I seen or heard of Anhingas flying through the woods.
</p>

<p>
For the following description of the Snake-bird’s breeding grounds,
a few miles distant from Charleston in South Carolina, I am indebted
to my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>:—“On the 28th of June 1837, accompanied
by Dr <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, Dr <span class="smcap">Drayton</span>, and <span class="smcap">William Ramsay</span>, Esq., I
went to Chisholm Pond, about seven miles from the city, for the purpose
of seeing the Anhingas while breeding. The day was fine, and
in about an hour our horses brought us to the margin of the swamp.
We soon discovered a bird flying over us, and making for the upper
part of the pond toward a retired place, rendered almost inaccessible
in consequence of its being a morass overgrown with vines and rushes.
As there was no other way of examining their locality but by water,
we hauled ashore a small leaky canoe which we found in the pond,
caulked it in the best manner we could, so as to render it not unsafe,
although after all we could do to it, we found it still very leaky. It
proved uncomfortable enough, and could hold only two persons. So it
was agreed that I should proceed in it, accompanied by a servant, who
understood well how to paddle it.
</p>

<p>
“The pond is artificial, and such as in this country is called a “Reserve.”
It is situated at the upper part of rice fields, and is intended
to preserve water sufficient, when needed, to irrigate and overflow the
rice. It is studded with small islands, covered by a thick growth of
a small species of Laurel (<i>Laurus geniculata</i>) and the Black Willow
(<i>Salix nigra</i>), all entangled by various species of Smilax and other
plants. These were at the time covered with Herons’ nests of several
kinds. Farther on the Night Herons also had formed a city. As I
proceeded onwards in my search I found the difficulties increasing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
The water became shallow, the mire deeper and softer, and the boat
required the best of management to be propelled along, for now it was
retarded by rushes and vines. Enormous live oaks and cypress trees
reared their majestic branches towards the pure sky above, covered as
they were with dangling masses of Spanish moss, reaching to the very
surface of the water, and turning day into night. Alligators of great
size wallowed in the mire, or were heard to plunge into it, from the
many logs which ever and anon intercepted my progress, while terrapins,
snakes, and other reptiles swarmed around.  My situation
was thus not altogether so very pleasant, and the less so as it was
necessary for me to destroy as many musquitoes as possible, and guard
against being upset in such a truly “dismal swamp.” We moved
extremely slowly, yet advanced, and at last, having reached an open
space where the trees were of small size and height, I espied the nest
of the Anhinga before me! The female was sitting on it, but on
our coming nearer she raised herself by her bill to a branch about
one foot above, and there stood with outstretched neck, like a statue.
It was cruel thus to disturb her in her own peaceful solitude; but
naturalists, alas! seldom consider this long, when the object of their
pursuit is in their view and almost within their grasp. Being now
within twenty yards of the innocent and interesting creature, I pointed
my short rifle towards her, and immediately fired; but the unsteadiness
of the canoe, and perhaps that of a hand not accustomed to this weapon,
saved her life. She remained in her statue-like posture, the rifle
was reloaded, and thrice fired, without touching her; but at last a
bullet having cut through the branch on which she stood, she spread
her dark pinions, and launching into the air, was soon beyond the reach
of my eyes, and I trust of further danger.”
</p>

<p>
The same kind friend having procured eggs and young of this interesting
bird, I will present you with his observations respecting them.
He writes thus:—“I brought home three young Snake-birds, two of
which I immediately undertook to raise and domesticate, entrusting the
third to the care of one of our mutual friends. I found no difficulty in
rearing one of them. The other, by neglect of my servant, died a few
weeks afterwards, during a short personal absence. Whilst these two
birds were yet in the same cage, it was curious indeed to see the smaller
one when hungry incessantly trying to force its bill into the mouth and
throat of the other, which, after being thus teased for a short time,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
would open its mouth to suffer the little one to thrust its whole head
down the throat of its brother, from which it would receive the fish
that the latter had previously swallowed. In this singular manner did
the larger bird, which after awhile proved to be a male, continue to act
as if the foster-parent of his little sister, which indeed seemed to be
thrown upon his protection. The one still in my possession is fed
on fish, which it picks up, tosses a few times in the air, and swallows
at the first convenient opportunity, that is when the fish falls towards
its mouth head foremost. At the onset, when the fish was large, I had it
cut into pieces, thinking that the apparent slenderness of the bird’s neck
could not expand enough to swallow it whole; but I soon ascertained that
this was unnecessary. Fish three times the size of the neck were tossed
in the expanded jaws and gobbled at once, and immediately after, the bird
would come to my feet, clicking its bill in such an unequivocal manner
that I never failed to give it more. My pet was tame from the
beginning of its captivity, and followed me about the house, the
yard, and garden, until I thought it quite troublesome in consequence
of its peculiar attachment to me. The one given to our friend was
fed on fish and raw beef; but although it grew to its full size, never
seemed to thrive as well as the one I had, and finally died of an affection
causing spasms. This was a female, and although less bright
in colour than the adult of the same sex, the two middle feathers of
her tail were partially crimped, and her markings were the same.
While in the young state I frequently carried it to a pond, believing
that it would relish the water, and would improve in health; but I invariably
found it to scramble towards the shore as soon as possible, as
if dreading the element in which it was by nature destined to live.
When thrown into the pond, it usually dived at once, but the next instant
arose to the surface, and swam with all the buoyancy of a common
duck. It is a fearless bird, keeping at bay the hens and turkeys
in the yard, and never sparing any dog that chances to pass by it,
dealing blows right and left with its sharp bill, and occasionally placing
itself at the trough where they are fed, to prevent them from taking a
morsel of food till he has tantalized them sufficiently, when he leaves
them to share whatever he does not himself relish.
</p>

<p>
“It was not until my bird was fully fledged that I found it willing
or anxious to go to the water, and then, whenever it saw me go toward
the pond, it accompanied me as far as the gate of the garden, seeming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
to say “Pray let me go.” On my opening this gate, it at once
followed me waddling along like a duck, and no sooner was it in sight of
its favourite element than it immediately let itself in, not with a plunge
or a dive, but by dropping from a plank into the stream, where for a
while it would swim like a duck, then, dipping its long neck, it would
dive for the purpose of procuring fish. The water was clear enough
to enable me to see all its movements, and after many various windings
it would emerge at the distance of forty or fifty yards. This bird
sleeps in the open air during warm nights, perched on the highest bar
of the fence, with its head under its wings, placed there from above its
back, and in rainy weather it often sits in the same position for nearly
the whole day. It appears to be very susceptible of cold, retreating
to the kitchen and near the fire, battling with the dogs or the cooks for
the most comfortable place on the hearth. Whenever the sun shines, it
spreads its wings and tail, rustles its feathers, and seems delighted
with our warmest sunny days. When walking and occasionally hopping,
it does not support itself by the tail, as Cormorants sometimes
do. When fishes are presented to it, it seizes and swallows them
greedily; but when these cannot be procured, we are forced to feed it
on meat, when it opens its mouth, and receives the food placed in it.
Occasionally it has spent several days without any food; but in those
cases the bird became very troublesome, harassing all around by its incessant
croakings, and giving blows to the servants, as if to remind
them of their neglect.
</p>

<p>
“Once it made its escape, and flew off about a quarter of a mile into
the pond. Some boys happening to be there in a canoe, the bird approached
them with open mouth, for it was hungry and wanted food.
They seeing such a strange creature pursuing them with a head somewhat
like that of a snake, took alarm and paddled for the shore; but
my bird followed in their wake, and landed as soon as they did. They
now fled to the house, where the Anhinga also arrived, and was recognised
by some members of the family, who sent it back to me;
and I, to prevent its farther escape or loss, clipped one of its wings.”
</p>

<p>
I saw the bird above mentioned at my friend’s house at Charleston
in the winter of 1836, when on my way to the Gulf of Mexico, and
had many opportunities of watching its habits. It was killed by a
beautiful retriever presented to me by the <span class="smcap">Earl of Derby</span>, and its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
death occasioned sorrow both to my friend and myself, as he had given
it to me for the purpose of being sent to that nobleman.
</p>

<p>
Ever since I have been acquainted with the Anhinga, I have
thought that in form and habits it is intimately connected with the
Cormorants, and was induced to compare their manners. In some respects
I found them similar, in others different; but when I discovered
that all these birds possess a remarkable peculiarity in the structure of
their feathers, I thought that their generic affinity could not be denied.
The Anhinga has its body and neck covered with what I would call
<i>fibrous</i> feathers, having a very slender shaft; while its quills and tail-feathers
are <i>compact</i>, that is, perfect in structure, strong, and elastic.
Now the shafts of all these latter feathers are <i>tubular from their bases
to their very extremities</i>, which, in so far as I know, is not the case in
any other bird, excepting the Cormorants. They are all very elastic,
like those in the tails of our largest Woodpeckers, the shafts of which,
however, are filled with a spongy pith, as in all other land-birds, and in
all the aquatic species which I have examined, including Divers and
Grebes, as well as <i>Plungers</i>, such as Gannets, Kings-fishers, and Fishing
Hawks. The quills and tail-feathers of the Cormorants and Anhinga,
in short, have the barrel as in other birds, but the shaft <i>hollow, even to
the tip, its walls being transparent, and of the same nature as the barrel</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, who, it is acknowledged, made his figures from stuffed
specimens in the Philadelphia Museum, had no positive proof that the
bird which he took for a female was one, for he had not seen the Anhinga
alive or recently killed. Even his continuator, Mr <span class="smcap">Ord</span>, procured
only males during his visit to the Floridas. But the female which
I have represented was proved to be of that sex by dissection, and was
examined by myself nineteen years ago near Bayou Sara. Since that
time I have had numerous opportunities of satisfying myself as to this
point, by examining birds in various stages.
</p>

<p>
The substances which I have found in many individuals of this species
were fishes of various kinds, aquatic insects, crays, leeches, shrimps,
tadpoles, eggs of frogs, water-lizards, young alligators, water-snakes,
and small terrapins. I never observed any sand or gravel in the stomach.
On some occasions I found it distended to the utmost, and, as
I have already stated, the bird has great powers of digestion. Its excrements
are voided in a liquid state, and squirted to a considerable distance,
as in Cormorants, Hawks, and all birds of prey.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The flesh of the Anhinga, after the bird is grown, is dark, firm, oily,
and unfit for food, with the exception of the smaller pectoral muscles
of the female, which are white and delicate. The crimpings of the
two middle tail-feathers become more deeply marked during the breeding
season, especially in the male. When young, the female shews
them only in a slight degree, and never has them so decided as the
male.

slightly recurved, rather slender, compressed, tapering to a fine point.
Upper mandible with the dorsal outline slightly declinate, and almost
straight, being however somewhat convex, the ridge convex, gradually
narrowed, the sides sloping, the edges sharp, and beyond the middle
cut into minute slender-pointed serratures, which are directed backwards;
the tips very slender. Lower mandible with the angle very
long and narrow, the dorsal line beyond it straight and ascending, the
sides sloping slightly outwards, the edges sharp and serrated like those
of the upper, the point extremely narrow; the gape line slightly ascending
towards the end. No external nostrils.
</p>

<p>
Head very small, oblong. Neck very long and slender. Body elongated
and slender. Feet very short and stout. Tibia feathered to
the joint. Tarsus very short, roundish, reticulated all over, the scales
on the hind part extremely small. Toes all connected by webs; the
first of moderate length, the second much longer, the fourth longest
and slightly margined externally; the first toe and the first phalanges
of the rest, covered above with transverse series of scales, the rest of
their extent scutellate. Claws rather large, very strong, compressed,
curved, very acute; the outer smallest, the third longest, with a deep
groove on the inner side, and a narrow thin edge, cut with parallel
slits; those of the first and second toes nearly equal.
</p>

<p>
There is a bare space at the base of the upper mandible, including
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
the eye; the skin of the throat is bare and dilated, like that of the
Cormorants. The plumage of the head, neck, and body, is close,
blended, and of a silky texture; the feathers oblong, rounded, with
the filament disunited toward the end. On each side of the neck, from
near the eye to half its length, is a series of elongated narrow loose
feathers, a few of which are also dispersed over the back of the neck,
and which in the breeding season are an inch and a quarter in length.
The scapulars, which are very numerous, are elongated, lanceolate, tapering
to a point, compact, stiffish, elastic, highly glossed, gradually
increasing in size backwards, the outer web of the largest, crimped.
Wings of moderate length and breadth; primaries strong, firm, considerably
curved, the third longest, the second almost as long, the first a
little shorter than the fourth; the second, third, and fourth cut out on
the outer web. Secondaries a little decurved, broad, rounded and acuminate;
the inner elongated, straightish, acuminate, and resembling
the posterior scapulars. Tail very long, narrow, of twelve straight
feathers having strong shafts, and increasing in breadth from the base
to the end, which is rounded and very broad, the two middle feathers
have their outer webs curiously marked with transverse alternate ridges
and depressions.
</p>

<p>
Upper mandible dusky olive, the edges yellow; lower mandible
bright yellow, the edges and tips greenish; bare space about the eye
bluish-green; gular sac bright orange. Iris bright carmine. Tarsi
and toes anteriorly dusky olive, the hind parts and webs yellow; claws
brownish-black. The general colour of the head, neck, and body, is
glossy blackish-green; of the scapulars, wings, and tail, glossy bluish-black.
The long loose feathers on the neck are purplish-white or pale
lilac. The lower part of the neck behind is marked with very numerous
minute oblong spots of white; which form two broad bands extending
backwards, and gradually becoming more elongated, there being
one along the centre of each feather including the scapulars. The
smaller wing-coverts are similarly marked with broader white spots
disposed in regular rows; the four last of which have merely a central
line towards the tip, while the inner has a broad band extending from
near the base over the outer half of the inner web, and towards the end
including a portion of the outer web; the first row of small coverts,
and the secondary coverts are white excepting the portion of the inner
web. The five inner elongated secondaries are marked with a narrow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
white band, occupying the inner half of the outer web, from about an
inch from their base to the extremity, near which it includes a part of
the inner web. The tail-feathers tipped with a band of brownish-red,
fading into white.

In external appearance and habits, the Snake-bird is very nearly
allied to the Cormorants. The structure of the feet is essentially the
same in both genera, as is that of the wings and tail, the latter however
being more elongated in the Anhinga, in correspondence with the
neck. If one might suppose a small Cormorant elongated and attenuated,
with the feet rather enlarged but shortened, the head diminished
in size, and the bill formed more on the model of that of a
Heron, being destitute of the distinct ridge and curved unguis, he
would form a pretty correct notion of this bird. Not only is the bill
like that of a Heron, but the vertebræ of the neck are very similar to
those of that family, and form the same abrupt curvatures between
the seventh and eighth vertebræ. But all the other bones are those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
of the Cormorants and Pelicans. The sternum in particular is almost
precisely similar to that of the Crested Cormorant, so that without
entering very minutely into its description, no differences could be
pointed out.
</p>

<p>
Both mandibles are concave within; the palate flat, with two longitudinal
ridges; the posterior aperture of the nares linear and 9 twelfths
long, the anterior or external aperture <i>entirely obliterated</i>. The lower
mandible has a distinct oblique joint at about a third of its length,
enabling it to be expanded to the extent of an inch and a half. The
pouch, which is small, is constructed in the same manner as that of
the Pelicans and Cormorants; its muscular fibres running from the
lower edge of the mandible downwards and backwards, and a slender
muscle passing from the anterior part of the hyoid bone to the junction
of the crura of the mandible. The tongue is reduced to a mere
oblong knob, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfth long, and <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> twelfth in height. The aperture
of the glottis is 3 twelfths long, with two roundish thin edged flaps behind,
destitute of papillæ. There is a small bone appended to the occipital
ridge, <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span> inch in length, as in the Cormorants.
</p>

<p>
The œsophagus <i>a b</i>, is 17 inches long, exceedingly delicate and dilatable,
with external longitudinal fibres, the transverse fibres becoming
stronger towards the lower parts. Its diameter when moderately dilated
is <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch at the top, 1 inch farther down, at its entrance into the thorax,
9 twelfths, and finally <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch; but it may be dilated to a much greater
extent. <i>The proventricular glands, instead of forming a belt at the lower part
of the œsophagus, are placed on the right side in the form of a globular sac</i>,
about an inch in diameter, communicating with the œsophagus, <i>b</i>, and stomach,
<i>d</i>. For two inches of the lower part of the œsophagus, <i>b</i>, or at that
part usually occupied by the proventriculus, the transverse muscular fibres
are enlarged, and form an abrupt margin beneath; on the inner surface
there are four irregular series of large apertures of gastric glandules or
crypts. The proventriculus itself, <i>c</i>, is composed of large crypts of irregular
form, with very wide apertures, and covered externally with
muscular fibres. The stomach, <i>d d</i>, is roundish, about an inch and three
quarters in diameter, with two roundish tendinous spaces, <i>e</i>, and fasciculi
of muscular fibres; its inner coat thin, soft, and smooth. It opens by
an aperture a quarter of an inch in diameter into a small sac, <i>f</i>, precisely
similar to that of the Pelican, which has a muscular coat, with a soft
even internal membrane, like that of the stomach. The pylorus has a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
diameter of 2 twelfths, is closed by a semilunar valve or flap, and is surrounded
by a disk of radiating rugæ three-fourths of an inch in diameter.
The intestine, <i>g h</i>, is 3 feet 4 inches long, its average diameter
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> twelfths, but only 1 twelfth at its junction with the rectum, which is
<span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, 3 twelfths in diameter. The cloaca globular, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch
in diameter. There are <i>no cœca</i> properly so called, but a <i>small rounded
termination of the rectum</i> 2 twelfths in length as in the Herons.

</p>

<p>
The subcutaneous cellular tissue is largely developed, and the longitudinal
cells on the neck are extremely large, as in Gannets and
Herons. The olfactory nerve is of moderate size, and the nasal cavity
is a simple compressed sac 4 twelfths in its greatest diameter. The
external nares are closed, and there are <i>no supraorbital glands</i>. The
external aperture at the ear is circular, and not more than half a
twelfth in diameter.
</p>

<p>
The trachea is <span class="mixfract">13&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, much flattened, narrow at the upper
extremity, where it is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths in breadth, enlarging gradually
to <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths, and toward the lower larynx contracting to <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths.
The rings are very slender, unossified, and feeble; their number 230;
the bronchial half-rings 25. The contractor muscles moderate; sterno-tracheales;
and a pair of inferior muscles going to the last ring.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In a young bird scarcely two days old, and measuring only <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches
in length, the two most remarkable circumstances observed refer to
the nostrils and stomach. The posterior or palatal aperture of the
nares is of the same form, and proportional size, as in the adult; the
nasal cavity is similar; but there is an external nasal aperture, or nostril,
on each side, so small as merely to admit the mystachial bristle of
a Common Squirrel. The stomach is of enormous size, occupying
three-fourths of the cavity of the thorax and abdomen, being 10 twelfths
of an inch long, and of an oval shape. The proventriculus is separated
from the stomach and formed into a roundish lobe, as in the old
bird; and beside it is the lobe or pouch appended to the stomach, and
from which the duodenum comes off. Even at this very early age, the
stomach was turgid with a pultaceous mass apparently composed of
macerated fish, without any bones or other hard substances intermixed.
</p>

<p>
Here then we have an instance of external nares in the young of a
bird in which they are entirely obliterated in the adult.

<p>
Although several years have elapsed since I visited the sterile
country of Labrador, I yet enjoy the remembrance of my rambles there;
nay, Reader, many times have I wished that you and I were in it once
more, especially in the winter season. I calculate indeed how easily
this wish might be accomplished, were I ten years younger. Under
the hospitable roof of Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, while the tempest might be hurling
southward the drifting snows, I could live in peaceful content, cheered
by the matchless hand-organ of my kind hostess. Then, how pleasant
it would be in calm weather to traverse the snowy wastes, to trap the
cunning fox and the Jer Falcon, allured by their favourite winter
food, the Rock Grous; with what delight should I gaze on the dim
red sun creeping along the southern horizon, or watch the flittering
beams of the northern aurora. Now, over the glittering snow, <span class="smcap">Jones</span>’s
Esquimaux curs might swiftly convey us to his friends, here crossing
the ice-bound gulf, there traversing fissures and crags impassable in
summer. Then what long tales for the long nights, and sports for the
short days. The broad-antlered Caribou might have scampered before
me, but its bounds would have been suddenly checked by the fleeter
ball of my well-directed rifle. The wolf might have prowled around
us, until he had been captured in the deeply dug and well-baited pit.
Then Nature’s pure mantle would be seen slowly to disappear, the low
grounds would be inundated with the snow-waters, the warm breezes
would dry the mountain ridges, and with the first appearance of verdure
joy would cause every heart to bound. Thousands of seals would be seen
to snuff the milder air, myriads of tiny fishes would approach the shores,
and millions of feathered wanderers would pass over on whistling
pinions. But alas! I shall never spend a winter in Labrador.
</p>

<p>
While proceeding towards that country in 1833, on board the Ripley,
I found the waters of the Gulf of St Lawrence alive with ducks
of different species. The nearer we approached the coast, the more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
numerous did they become; and of the many kinds that presented
themselves to our anxious gaze, the Surf Duck was certainly not the
least numerous. It is true that in the noble bays of our own coast,
in the Sound, between New York and the Hook, on the broader waters
of the Chesapeake, and beyond them to the mouths of the Mississippi,
I had seen thousands of Surf Ducks; but the numbers that passed the
shores of Labrador, bound for the far north, exceeded all my previous
conceptions.
</p>

<p>
For more than a week after we had anchored in the lovely harbour
of Little Macatina, I had been anxiously searching for the nest of this
species, but in vain: the millions that sped along the shores had no
regard to my wishes. At length I found that a few pairs had remained
in the neighbourhood, and one morning, while in the company of Captain
<span class="smcap">Emery</span>, searching for the nests of the Red-breasted Merganser,
over a vast oozy and treacherous fresh-water marsh, I suddenly started
a female Surf Duck from her treasure. We were then about five miles
distant from our harbour, from which our party had come in two boats,
and fully five and a half miles from the waters of the Gulf of St Lawrence.
The marsh was about three miles in length, and so unsafe that
more than once we both feared, as we were crossing it, that we might
never reach its margin. The nest was snugly placed amid the tall
leaves of a bunch of grass, and raised fully four inches above its roots.
It was entirely composed of withered and rotten weeds, the former
being circularly arranged over the latter, producing a well-rounded
cavity, six inches in diameter, by two and a half in depth. The borders
of this inner cup were lined with the down of the bird, in the
same manner as the Eider Duck’s nest, and in it lay five eggs, the
smallest number I have ever found in any duck’s nest. They were
two inches and two and a half eighths in length, by one inch and five-eighths
in their greatest breadth; more equally rounded at both ends
than usual; the shell perfectly smooth, and of a uniform pale yellowish
or cream colour. I took them on board, along with the female
bird, which was shot as she rose from her nest. We saw no male bird
near the spot; but in the course of the same day, met with several
males by themselves, about four miles distant from the marsh, as we
were returning to the harbour. This induced me to believe that, like
the Eider and other ducks that breed in Labrador, the males abandon
the females as soon as incubation commences. I regret that, notwithstanding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
all my further exertions, I did not succeed in discovering
more nests or young birds.
</p>

<p>
In the States of Maine and Massachusetts, this species is best known
by the name of “Butter-boat-billed Coot.” The gunners of Long
Island and New Jersey call it the Black Sea Duck. It is often seen
along the coast of South Carolina, where my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>
Has met with it. The Surf Duck is a powerful swimmer and an expert
diver. It is frequently observed fishing at the depth of several
fathoms, and it floats buoyantly among the surf or the raging billows,
where it seems as unconcerned as if it were on the most tranquil
waters. It rises on wing, however, with considerable difficulty, and
in this respect resembles the Velvet Duck; but when once fairly under
way, it flies with rapidity and to a great distance, passing close to the
water during heavy gales, but at the height of forty or fifty yards in
calm and pleasant weather. It is an uncommonly shy bird, and therefore
difficult to be obtained, unless shot at while on wing, or when
asleep, and as it were at anchor on our bays, or near the shore, for it
dives as suddenly as the Velvet and Scoter Ducks, eluding even the best
percussion-locked guns. The female, which was killed as she flew off
from the nest, uttered a rough uncouth guttural cry, somewhat resembling
that of the Goosander on similar occasions; and I have never
heard any other sound from either sex.
</p>

<p>
The migration of the Surf Ducks eastward from our Southern coast,
begins at a very early season, as in the beginning of March none are
to be seen in the New Orleans markets. When I was at Eastport in
Maine, on the 7th of May 1833, they were all proceeding eastward.
How far up the St Lawrence they advance in winter I have not learned,
but they must give a decided preference to the waters of that noble
stream, if I may judge by the vast numbers which I saw apparently
coming from them as we approached the Labrador coast. I have never
seen this species on any fresh-water lake or river, in any part of the
interior, and therefore consider it as truly a marine duck.
</p>

<p>
During their stay with us, they are always seen in considerable
numbers together, and, unless perhaps during the breeding season,
they seem to be gregarious; for even during their travels northward
they always move in large and compact bodies. When I was at Newfoundland,
I was assured that they breed there in considerable numbers
on the lakes of the interior. My friend Professor <span class="smcap">Macculloch</span>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
of Pictou, however informs me that none are seen in Nova Scotia in
summer. A gentleman of Boston, with whom I once crossed the Atlantic,
assured me that the species is extremely abundant on the northern
shores of the Pacific Ocean, and about the mouth of Mackenzie’s
River. Doctor <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> mentions it as being also found on the Columbia.
It appears that a single specimen of the Surf Duck has been
procured on the shores of Great Britain; and this has induced the ornithologists
of that country to introduce it as a constituent of its Fauna.
</p>

<p>
In all the individuals which I have examined, I have found the stomach
to contain fish of different kinds, several species of shell-fish,
and quantities of gravel and sand, some of the fragments being of
large size. Their flesh is tough, rank, and fishy, so as to be scarcely
fit for food.
</p>

<p>
In the young males, in the month of September, the whole upper
plumage is mottled with darkish-brown and greyish-white, the latter
colour margining most of the feathers. The neck has a considerable
extent of dull greyish-white, spread over two or three inches, and approaching
toward the cheeks and throat. This colour disappears about
the beginning of January, when they become of a more uniform dark tint,
the upper part of the head brownish-black, without any white spot;
there is a patch of brownish-white at the base of the upper mandible
on each side; another of an oblong form over the ear, and on the nape
are elongated greyish-white marks; the bill and feet dusky green, the
iris brown.

In an adult Male, the tongue is 1 inch 9 twelfths long, has numerous
conical papillæ at the base, is deeply grooved along the middle,
has two lateral series of bristles, and terminates in a thin rounded lobe,
2 twelfths long. On the middle line of the upper mandible are about
ten short conical papillæ, and on each of its margins about 35 lamellæ;
on the lower an equal number. The heart is 1 inch 8 twelfths long,
1 inch 2 twelfths broad. The œsophagus, <span class="mixfract">8&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, is wide, its

</p>

<p>
The aperture of the glottis is 8 twelfths long, with numerous minute
papillæ behind. The trachea presents the same structure as that of the
Velvet Duck. Its upper rings, to the number of 9, are very narrow,
and continuous with a large bony expansion, 7 twelfths long, and 8
twelfths broad. Beyond this part its diameter is 5 twelfths, gradually
diminishes to 3 twelfths about the middle, then enlarges to 5 twelfths.
In this part the number of rings is 78. Then comes a roundish or
transversely elliptical enlargement, 1 inch 2 twelfths in breadth,
9 twelfths in length, convex before, slightly concave behind, and composed
of about 12 united rings. The trachea then contracts to 4 twelfths
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
and presently enlarges to form the inferior larynx, which is large, ossified,
but symmetrical. In this space there are 6 distinct rings, and
10 united. The entire length of the trachea is <span class="mixfract">7&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches, its rings are
all osseous and strong. The contractor muscles are very strong, pass
along the sides of the lower dilatation, on which are given off the cleido-tracheals,
then continue to the commencement of the inferior larynx,

<h2>
AMERICAN AVOSET.

<span class="smcap"><i>Recurvirostra Americana</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXVIII. Adult Male, and Young in Winter</span>.

<p>
The fact of this curious bird’s breeding in the interior of our country
accidentally became known to me in June 1814. I was at the time
travelling on horseback from Henderson to Vincennes in the State of
Indiana. As I approached a large shallow pond in the neighbourhood
of the latter town, I was struck by the sight of several Avosets hovering
over the margins and islets of the pond, and although it was late,
and I was both fatigued and hungry, I could not resist the temptation
of endeavouring to find the cause of their being so far from the sea.
Leaving my horse at liberty, I walked toward the pond, when, on being
at once assailed by four of the birds, I felt confident that they had
nests, and that their mates were either sitting or tending their young.
The pond, which was about two hundred yards in length, and half
as wide, was surrounded by tall bulrushes extending to some distance
from the margin. Near its centre were several islets, eight or
ten yards in length, and disposed in a line. Having made my way
through the rushes, I found the water only a few inches deep; but the
mud reached above my knees, as I carefully advanced towards the
nearest island. The four birds kept up a constant noise, remained on
wing, and at times dived through the air until close to me, evincing
their displeasure at my intrusion. My desire to shoot them however
was restrained by my anxiety to study their habits as closely as possible;
and as soon as I had searched the different inlets, and found three
nests with eggs, and a female with her brood, I returned to my horse,
and proceeded to Vincennes, about two miles distant. Next morning
at sunrise I was snugly concealed amongst the rushes, with a fair view
of the whole pond. In about an hour the male birds ceased to fly over
me, and betook themselves to their ordinary occupations, when I noted
the following particulars.
</p>

<p>
On alighting, whether on the water or on the ground, the American
Avoset keeps its wings raised until it has fairly settled. If in the water,
it stands a few minutes balancing its head and neck, somewhat in
the manner of the Tell-tale Godwit. After this it stalks about searching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
for food, or runs after it, sometimes swimming for a yard or so
while passing from one shallow to another, or wading up to its body,
with the wings partially raised. Sometimes they would enter among
the rushes, and disappear for several minutes. They kept apart, but
crossed each other’s path in hundreds of ways, all perfectly silent, and
without shewing the least symptom of enmity towards each other, although
whenever a Sandpiper came near, they would instantly give
chase to it. On several occasions, when I purposely sent forth a loud
shrill whistle without stirring, they would suddenly cease from their
rambling, raise up their body and neck, emit each two or three notes,
and remain several minutes on the alert, after which they would fly to
their nests, and then return. They search for food precisely in the
manner of the Roseate Spoonbill, moving their heads to and fro sideways,
while their bill is passing through the soft mud; and in many
instances, when the water was deeper, they would immerse their whole
head and a portion of the neck, as the Spoonbill and Red-breasted
Snipe are wont to do. When, on the contrary, they pursued aquatic
insects, such as swim on the surface, they ran after them, and on getting
up to them, suddenly seized them by thrusting the lower mandible
beneath them, while the other was raised a good way above the surface,
much in the manner of the Black Shear-water, which however performs
this act on wing. They were also expert at catching flying insects,
after which they ran with partially expanded wings.
</p>

<p>
I watched them as they were thus engaged about an hour, when
they all flew to the islets where the females were, emitting louder notes
than usual. The different pairs seemed to congratulate each other,
using various curious gestures; and presently those which had been sitting
left the task to their mates and betook themselves to the water,
when they washed, shook their wings and tail, as if either heated or
tormented by insects, and then proceeded to search for food in the
manner above described. Now, Reader, wait a few moments until I eat
my humble breakfast.
</p>

<p>
About eleven o’clock the heat had become intense, and the Avosets
gave up their search, each retiring to a different part of the pond, where,
after pluming themselves, they drew their heads close to their shoulders,
and remained perfectly still, as if asleep, for about an hour, when
they shook themselves simultaneously, took to wing, and rising to the
height of thirty or forty yards, flew off towards the waters of the Wabash
River.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I was now desirous of seeing one of the sitting birds on its nest,
and leaving my hiding place, slowly, and as silently as possible, proceeded
toward the nearest islet on which I knew a nest to be, having
the evening before, to mark the precise spot, broken some of the weeds,
which were now withered by the heat of the sun. You, good Reader,
will not, I am sure, think me prolix; but as some less considerate
persons may allege that I am tediously so, I must tell them here that
no student of Nature ever was, or ever can be, too particular while
thus marking the precise situation of a bird’s nest. Indeed, I myself
have lost many nests by being less attentive. After this short but valuable
lecture, you and I will do our best to approach the sitting bird
unseen by it. Although a person can advance but slowly when wading
through mud and water knee-deep, it does not take much time to get
over forty or fifty yards, and thus I was soon on the small island where
the Avoset was comfortably seated on her nest. Softly and on all four
I crawled toward the spot, panting with heat and anxiety. Now,
Reader, I am actually within three feet of the unheeding creature,
peeping at her through the tall grasses. Lovely bird! how innocent,
how unsuspecting, and yet how near to thine enemy, albeit he be an
admirer of thy race! There she sits on her eggs, her head almost
mournfully sunk among the plumage, and her eyes, unanimated by
the sight of her mate, half closed, as if she dreamed of future scenes.
Her legs are bent beneath her in the usual manner. I have seen
this, and I am content. Now she observes me, poor thing, and off
she scrambles,—running, tumbling, and at last rising on wing, emitting
her clicking notes of grief and anxiety, which none but an inconsiderate
or callous-hearted person could hear without sympathizing
with her.
</p>

<p>
The alarm is sounded, the disturbed bird is floundering hither
and thither over the pool, now lying on the surface as if ready to
die, now limping to induce me to pursue her and abandon her eggs.
Alas, poor bird! Until that day I was not aware that gregarious
birds, on emitting cries of alarm, after having been scared from their
nest, could induce other incubating individuals to leave their eggs also,
and join in attempting to save the colony. But so it was with the Avosets,
and the other two sitters immediately rose on wing and flew directly at
me, while the one with the four younglings betook herself to the water,
and waded quickly off, followed by her brood, which paddled along
swimming, to my astonishment, as well as ducklings of the same size.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
</p>

<p>
How far such cries as those of the Avoset may be heard by birds of
the same species I cannot tell; but this I know, that the individuals
which had gone toward the Wabash reappeared in a few minutes
after I had disturbed the first bird, and hovered over me. But now,
having, as I thought, obtained all desirable knowledge of these birds,
I shot down five of them, among which I unfortunately found three
females.
</p>

<p>
The nests were placed among the tallest grasses, and were entirely
composed of the same materials, but dried, and apparently of a former
year’s growth. There was not a twig of any kind about them. The
inner nest was about five inches in diameter, and lined with fine prairie
grass, different from that found on the islets of the pond, and about
two inches in depth, over a bed having a thickness of an inch and a
half. The islets did not seem to be liable to inundation, and none of
the nests exhibited any appearance of having been increased in
elevation since the commencement of incubation, as was the case
with those described by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>. Like those of most waders, the
eggs were four in number, and placed with the small ends together.
They measured two inches in length, one inch and three-eighths in
their greatest breadth, and were, exactly as <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> tells us, “of
a dull olive colour, marked with large irregular blotches of black,
and with others of a fainter tint.” To this I have to add, that they
are pear-shaped and smooth. As to the time of hatching, I know
nothing.
</p>

<p>
Having made my notes, and picked up the dead birds, I carefully
waded through the rushes three times around the whole pond, but,
being without my dog, failed in discovering the young brood or their
mother. I visited the place twice the following day, again waded
round the pond, and searched all the islets, but without success: not
a single Avoset was to be seen; and I am persuaded that the mother
of the four younglings had removed them elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Since that time my opportunities of meeting with the American
Avoset have been few. On the 7th of November 1819, while searching
for rare birds a few miles from New Orleans, I shot one which I
found by itself on the margin of Bayou St John. It was a young
male, of which I merely took the measurements and description. It
was very thin, and had probably been unable to proceed farther south.
Its stomach contained only two small fresh-water snails and a bit of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
stone. In May 1829, I saw three of these birds at Great Egg Harbour,
but found no nests, although those of the Long-legged Avoset
of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> were not uncommon. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> considers
them as rare in South Carolina, where, however, he has occasionally
seen some on the gravelly shores of the sea islands.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of April 1837, my good friend Captain <span class="smcap">Napoleon
Coste</span>, of the United States Revenue Cutter the Campbell, on board
of which I then was, shot three individuals of this species on an immense
sand-bar, intersected by pools, about twelve miles from Derniere
Island on the Gulf of Mexico, and brought them to me in perfect
order. They were larger, and perhaps handsomer, than any that I
have seen; and had been killed out of a flock of five while feeding.
He saw several large flocks on the same grounds, and assured me
that the only note they emitted was a single whistle. He also observed
their manner of feeding, which he represented as similar to that
described above.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> says in a note, that he “found this
species breeding on the islands of shallow ponds throughout the Rocky
Mountains about midsummer. They exhibited great fear and clamour
at the approach of the party, but no nests were found, they being then
under march.” Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states, that it is abundant on the Saskatchewan
Plains, where it frequents shallow lakes, and feeds on insects
and small fresh water crustacea.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the American Avoset resembles that of the <i>Himantopus
nigricollis</i>. Both these birds pass through the air as if bent on removing
to a great distance, much in the manner of the Tell-tale Godwit,
or with an easy, rather swift and continued flight, the legs and neck
fully extended. When plunging towards an intruder, it at times comes
downwards, and passes by you, with the speed of an arrow from a bow,
but usually in moving off again, it suffers its legs to hang considerably.
I have never seen one of them exhibit the bending and tremulous motions
of the legs spoken of by writers, even when raised suddenly from
the nest; and I think that I am equally safe in saying, that the bill
has never been drawn from a fresh specimen, or before it has undergone
a curvature, which it does not shew when the bird is alive. The
notes of this bird resemble the syllable <i>click</i>, sometimes repeated in a
very hurried manner, especially under alarm.

LEAST TERN.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna minuta</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXIX. Adult and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
Sylph-like bird of the waters, how delightful has it been to me to
gaze on thy gliding movements, on the fannings of thy gentle wings,
on the delicate silvery glance of thy soft and sattiny bosom, as thou
camest from distant and unknown shores, when the winter had passed
away, and the mild breezes of early summer blew around thee, and
thou soughtest a place of safety in which to sojourn for a time. That
frail frame of thine must have suffered many a hardship. Fronting
that last damp and chilling blast, I have seen thee gathering up all
thy little strength to force thy way; and when the fury of the tempest
assailed thee, wert thou not glad to seek for refuge under yon bold headland!
Ah, deny it not, for I have seen the delight expressed by thee,
when after awhile, returning calm and sunshine revived thee, and thou
spreadest thy wings anew, to ramble gaily over the still turbulent waters.
Well knowest thou, heaven-taught, each bar and shallow along
the desolate shore which thou skirtest pilotless; soon shalt thou reach the
haven where last summer smiled on thee and thy brood; and there shalt
thou gracefully alight by the side of one whose love is all to thee.
</p>

<p>
As no account of this species exists in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, it
is to be supposed that it is not met with beyond the western shores of Labrador,
where however I found it in abundance and breeding, in the beginning
of June 1833. On the 14th of August following I observed them
at Newfoundland, moving southward in detached parties of old and young,
against a strong breeze, and uttering their clamorous cries. Again,
in the end of April 1837, hundreds of pairs were breeding on the islands
of Galveston Bay in Texas, the numerous specimens which I then examined
exhibiting no difference from those obtained in Labrador and
in our Middle Districts. Nay, once, in the middle of June, while
wading through the quick-sands of Bayou Sara in Louisiana, I came
to a high and dry sand-bar where I picked up several eggs belonging
to three pairs of birds of this species, although the distance was about
two hundred miles from the sea in a direct line. I have at various times
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
observed this Tern on the waters of the Ohio in autumn, and now and
then in spring, at the latter period in company with the Short-tailed Tern,
<i>Sterna nigra</i>, and have again met with it on the shores of Lake Erie.
I have also found it in winter on the eastern coast of the Floridas, but
in small numbers. Few birds indeed seem to me to be so irregular in
their migratory movements, for they appear to stop at any convenient
breeding place from Texas to Labrador.
</p>

<p>
This species in some of its habits resembles the Marsh Tern, of
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, which I feel certain is the <i>Sterna anglica</i> of <span class="smcap">Montagu</span>. The resemblance
is especially manifest in the peculiar manner in which it
seizes insects while on wing over the pools of salt marshes and elsewhere,
where it is fond of rambling whenever the weather is at all
fine or pleasantly warm. It then plunges toward the ground or the
water, and, like a true Flycatcher, snatches its prey unawares from
the tops of the grasses, or whilst flying over the shallow green-mantled
pools.
</p>

<p>
Few birds are more gentle than this delicate species is at times; for,
apparently unaware of danger from the vicinity of man, it allows him to
approach within a few yards, whether it be on wing or on the ground.
Indeed, in the latter case, I have seen it when gorged so reluctant to
fly off that I have more than once thought it was asleep, although on
coming up I was always disappointed in my attempts to catch it. Nothing
can exceed the lightness of the flight of this bird, which seems
to me to be among water-fowls, the analogue of the Humming-bird.
They move with great swiftness at times, at others balance themselves
like hawks over their prey, then dart with the velocity of thought
to procure the tiny fry beneath the surface of the waters.  When
you invade their breeding place, they will sometimes sweep far away,
and suddenly return, coming so near as almost to strike you. While
travelling, their light but firm flight is wonderfully sustained; and on
hearing and seeing them on such occasions, one is tempted to believe
them to be the happiest of the happy. They seem as if marshalled
and proceeding to a merry-making, so gaily do they dance along, as if
to the music of their own lively cries. Now you see the whole group
suddenly check their onward speed, hover over a deep eddy supplied
with numberless shrimps, and dash headlong on their prey. Up
rises the little thing with the shrimp in its bill, and again down it
plunges; and its movements are so light and graceful that you look on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
with pleasure, and are in no haste to depart. Should this scene be enacted
while they have young in their company, the latter await in the
air the rise of their parents, meet them, and receive the food from
them. When all are satiated, they proceed on their journey, stopping
at another similar but distant place.
</p>

<p>
Although along our Southern and Middle Districts, the Least Tern
merely scoops a very slight hollow in which to deposit its eggs, doing
this from the first of April to the first of June, according to the
latitude of the place, those which I found breeding on the coast of
Labrador had formed very snug nests, composed of short fragments of
dry moss, well matted together, and nearly of the size of that of the
American Robin, <i>Turdus migratorius</i>; while those met with on the islands
near the Bay of Galveston, were observed to have laid their eggs upon
the dry drifted weeds which appeared to have been gathered by them
for the purpose. The nests are generally placed out of reach of the
tides, but on some occasions I have known the hopes of a whole colony
destroyed by the sudden overflow of their selected places caused by
a severe gale, and have observed that, on such occasions, their clamour
was as great as if they had been robbed of their eggs by man.
</p>

<p>
The number of eggs deposited by this species is more frequently
three than four. Like those of most other Terns, they differ somewhat
in size and markings, although I never found any so large as
those described by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, who states that they measure nearly an
inch and three quarters in length, which would better agree with the
eggs of the Common Tern. The average of a basketful was found to
be one inch and two and a half eighths in length, by seven and a half
eighths in breadth. They are rather pointed at the smaller end, and
their ground colour is pale yellowish-white, blotched with irregular
dark brown spots, intermixed with others of a dull purplish tint.
</p>

<p>
I have found this Tern breeding among Shearwaters along the Florida
coast; and my friend the Reverend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> has observed
the same circumstance on the “Bird’s Banks,” on the coasts of South
Carolina, where it is abundant, as well as on Sullivan Island.
</p>

<p>
The common note of our Least Tern resembles that of the Barn
Swallow when disturbed about its nest, being as smartly and rapidly
repeated at times. When it proves convenient for it to alight on the
ground or on a sand-beach, after it has secured a prawn or small fish,
it does so, and there devours its prey piecemeal, but it more usually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
swallows it on wing. On the ground it walks prettily, with short steps,
keeping its tail somewhat raised.

LITTLE SANDPIPER.

<span class="smcap"><i>Tringa pusilla</i>, Wils.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Before proceeding to detail my observations on the habits of this
humble but extremely interesting  bird, I deem it necessary to inform
you that I disclaim as species belonging to the United States, or even
to any part of North America, the following, which however are given
in the Synopsis of the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>, and in the work of my
generous friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, viz., <i>Tringa platyrhincha</i> of <span class="smcap">Temminck</span>,
<i>T. Temminckii</i> of <span class="smcap">Leisler</span>, <i>T. minuta</i> of <span class="smcap">Leisler</span>, <i>T. minuta</i> of
<span class="smcap">Temminck</span>, and <i>T. pusilla</i> of <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>. This opinion of mine I divulged
to the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span> in London, and he has on this
account omitted these species in his recently published list. The extreme
confusion that exists with respect to these species, and many others of the
same tribe, is in my opinion caused solely by the anxiety of authors to
discover or invent new species, often founding distinctions on slight differences
in the length of bills, tarsi, or toes. Now, Reader, if in such large
species as the <i>Grus Americana</i>, for example, the young has been palmed
on the world of science as a distinct species for nearly a century past,
without any other kind of reason or proof than that obtained from
mere dried skins, can we be surprised that in birds so small as the
present, opportunities should have occurred of committing errors.
My opinion, which I do not present to you without due consideration,
is, that we have in the United States only the diminutive species
badly figured by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, and almost as carelessly described by that
wonderful man. To enter upon a long discussion as to the identity
of the present bird with any of the small Tringas enumerated
by European authors, would be to me quite as irksome as it would
prove unprofitable to you, for there scarcely exists a single description
of these birds sufficiently accurate to enable one to decide with
certainty. All are as nearly as possible of the same size and colour,
excepting in those deviations dependent upon age, and the different
states of plumage.  But in the most intimately allied species there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
are always marked differences in habits, and especially in the sound
of the voice.
</p>

<p>
That this species is naturally disposed to seek alpine sections of
the country for the purpose of reproduction, I obtained abundant proof
whilst in Labrador, where I found it plentiful, and breeding on the
moss-clad crests of the highest rocks, within short distances of the sea.
There are means through which the experienced student of Nature
may discover the hidden treasures of birds of this family, which to
others would prove useless, and which I shall here point out. At all
periods, excepting those at which they have nests containing eggs, or
young so small and delicate as to require all the care of their parents,
the flight of the present species usually resembles that of the Common
Snipe, <i>Scolopax Wilsonii</i>; but when startled from the nest, or from any
place in its immediate vicinity, it rises on wing, and moves off low over
the ground with deeply incurved wings, and with a whirring motion of
these organs, which, if as rapid as that of a Partridge, would appear
quite similar; but, on such occasions, our bird moves slowly before you,
and instead of uttering the note of independence, as it were, which it emits
at other times while freely and fearlessly travelling, it gives out sounds
weakened as if by grief or anxiety, for the purpose of inducing you to
follow it. If on the ground, it acts in a similar manner, moves off
slowly, and limping as if crippled, and this at times quite as much as
if you had really come upon it while on its nest, or surprised it with
its young. On all such occasions, Reader, you ought to mark well the
spot from which the bird has started, and, to assure yourself that your
eye may not be deceived, throw your cap or hat at your feet to serve
as a beacon, should necessity afterwards call for it, to guide you around
the place until you have discovered the nest which you are desirous of
seeing.
</p>

<p>
Through these means, on the 20th of July 1838, I after some
search found the nest and eggs of this species. The birds flew, to use
the words of my Journal, like Partridges, and not like Tringas. I
marked them well, for both the female and the male flew from near
the nest, and having left my fisher’s hat where I then stood, I walked
carefully over the moss hither and thither, until at last I came upon
the spot. My pleasure would have been greatly augmented had any
of my young companions been near; but the sailors who had rowed
me to the foot of the rocks exhibited little more delight than they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
would have done on finding that their grog had been stopped. For
my part, I felt as happy as when, on the same coast, I for the first
time saw the nest and eggs of the Black-crowned Warbler, of which
you have read an account, in the second volume of this work. Four
beautiful eggs, larger than I had expected to see produced by birds
of so small a size, lay fairly beneath my eye as I knelt over them
for several minutes in perfect ecstasy.  The nest had been formed
first, apparently, by the patting of the little creature’s feet on the
crisp moss, and in the slight hollow thus produced were laid a few
blades of slender dry grass bent in a circular manner, the internal diameter
of the nest being two inches and a half, and its depth an inch
and a quarter. The eggs, which were in shape just like those of the
Spotted Sandpiper, <i>Totanus macularius</i>, measured seven and a half
eighths of an inch in length, and three-fourths of an inch in breadth.
Their ground colour was a rich cream-yellow tint, blotched and dotted
with very dark umber, the markings larger and more numerous toward
the broad end. They were placed with their pointed ends together,
and were quite fresh. The nest lay under the lea of a small rock, exposed
to all the heat the sun can afford in that country. No sooner had
the little creatures felt assured that I had discovered their treasure,
than they manifested a great increase of sorrow, flew from the top of
one crag to another in quick succession, and emitted notes resembling
the syllables <i>peep</i>, <i>peet</i>, which were by no means agreeable to my feelings,
for I was truly sorry to rob them of their eggs, although impelled
to do so by the love of science, which affords a convenient excuse
for even worse acts.
</p>

<p>
This pair, however, would seem to have been late in depositing
their eggs, for on the 4th of August my party and myself saw young
birds almost as large as their parents, and agreeing in almost every
point with the descriptions given of <i>Tringa Temminckii</i>. Many small
flocks of these birds, consisting of old and young, were already departing
from Labrador, and were seen on all our excursions. On the 11th
of August, we also found adult and young in great numbers. But not
a single newly hatched individual of this species could I procure, while
the young of the Ring Plover were very abundant.
</p>

<p>
I was surprised, whilst rambling along the shores of the Raritan
River, between New Jersey and New York, to find a great number of
Little Sandpipers, on the 29th of July 1832, leading me to believe that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
they had probably bred on the elevated portions of Staten Island, although
on the other hand, they might have been barren birds. I have
been equally astonished to see large flocks of this species on the sand-bars
along the shores of the Ohio, below the great Rapids, about the
middle of August. According to Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, it “breeds within
the Arctic Circle, arriving as soon as the snow melts. It was observed
on the 21st of May, on the swampy borders of small lakes in latitude
66°. The crops of those we killed were filled with a soft blackish
earth, and some white worms.” From the above quotation, I would
be almost inclined to believe that, like some others of our birds, which
are said to be found in northern Europe, this might be one.
</p>

<p>
The habits of the Little Sandpiper have been described with great
care and accuracy by my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>. His account is indeed
so perfect that I shall here lay it before you in preference to one
by myself. “The Peeps, as they have been called, are seen in the salt
marshes around Boston, as early as the 8th of July. Indeed, so seldom
are they absent from us in the summer season, that they might be taken
for denizens of the state, or the neighbouring countries. When they
arrive, now and then accompanied by the semi-palmated species, the
air is sometimes, as it were, clouded with their flocks. Companies led
from place to place in quest of food, are seen whirling suddenly in circles,
with a desultory flight, at a distance, resembling a swarm of hiving
bees, seeking out some object on which to settle. At this time,
deceiving them by an imitation of their sharp and querulous whistle,
the fowler approaches, and adds destruction to the confusion of their
timorous and restless flight. Flocking together for common security,
the fall of their companions, and their plaintive cry, excite so much
sympathy among the harmless Peeps, that, forgetting their own safety,
or not well perceiving the cause of the fatality which the gun spreads
among them, they fall sometimes in such a state of confusion, as to be
routed with but little effort, until the greedy sportsman is glutted with
his timorous and infatuated game. When much disturbed, they,
however, separate into small and wandering parties, and are now
seen gleaning their fare of larvæ, worms, minute shell-fish, and insects,
in the salt marshes, or on the muddy and sedgy shores of tide rivers
and ponds. At such times they may be very nearly approached, betraying
rather a heedless familiarity than a timorous mistrust of their
most wily enemy; and even when rudely startled, they will often return
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
to the same place in the next instant, to pursue their lowly occupation
of scraping in the mud, whence, probably, originated the contemptible
appellation of <i>Humility</i>, by which they and some other small
birds of similar habits have been distinguished. For the discovery
of their food, their flexible and sensitive awl-like bills are thrust into
the mire, marshy soil, or wet sand, in the manner of the Snipe and
Woodcock, and in this way they discover and route from their hiding
retreat, the larvæ and soft worms which form a principal part of their
fare. At other times, they also give chase to insects, and pursue
their calling with amusing alacrity.  When at length startled, or
about to join the company they have left, a sharp, short, and monotonous
whistle, like the word <i>peet</i>, or <i>peep</i>, is uttered, and they instantly
take to wing, and course along with the company they had
left. On seeing the larger marsh-birds feeding, as the Yellow-shanks
and others, a whirling flock of the Peeps will descend among them,
being generally allowed to feed in quiet; and at the approach of the
sportsman, these little timorous rovers are ready to give the alarm.
At first, a slender <i>peep</i> is heard, which is then followed by two or three
others, and presently <i>peep</i>, <i>pip</i>, <i>pip’ p’p</i>, murmurs in a lisping whistle
through the quailing ranks, as they rise on the wing, and inevitably
entice with them their larger but less watchful associates. Towards
evening in fine weather, the marshes almost re-echo with the shrill but
rather murmuring or lisping, subdued, and querulous call of <i>peet</i>, and
then a repetition of <i>pé-dee</i>, <i>pé-dée</i>, <i>deĕ-dĕe</i>, which seems to be the collecting
cry of the old birds calling together their brood, for, when assembled,
the note changes into a confused murmur of <i>peet</i>, <i>peet</i>, attended
by a short and suppressed whistle.”
</p>

<p>
During my never-to-be-forgotten residence at Henderson, on the
banks of the fair Ohio, I was in the habit of frequently seeing large
flocks of these birds on the sandy shores of that river, during the
autumnal months, and finding after a while that they could easily be
driven into a partridge net, I laid one accordingly on several occasions,
when, by using gentle means, I induced many dozens of these
tiny, fat, and delicious birds to enter and become prisoners. I clipped
the wings of many of them, and turned them loose in my garden, for
the purpose of studying their habits in this sort of half-confined state;
but they were all soon destroyed by these most destructive pests, the
Norway rats, which at that time infested all my premises.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I found these birds quite abundant on the whole coast of Florida,
during winter, and I have no doubt that many remain with
us all the year; indeed, it would not at all surprise me to hear
that some of them actually breed in parts of the alpine districts
of our Middle States. I have also found them equally numerous
along the whole coast of the Bay of Mexico, during my recent visit to
Texas, when, late in April, some of them were still travelling from
farther south-west, and proceeding eastward. In South Carolina, they
are frequent in spring and autumn, along the borders of the rice fields,
and inland fresh-water ponds.
</p>

<p>
Since writing the above, my friend Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> has furnished
me with a list of some of the birds seen by him on the Rocky Mountains
and the Columbia River, in which this species is mentioned as
being found along the shores of that celebrated stream of the far west.

<p>
This beautiful and singular bird, although a constant resident in the
southern extremities of the peninsula of Florida, seldom extends its
journeys in an eastern direction beyond the State of North Carolina.
Indeed it is of extremely rare occurrence there, and even in South Carolina,
my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> informs me that he has observed
only three individuals in the course of twenty years. He once obtained
a specimen in full plumage about ten miles north of Charleston. It is
rarely seen in the interior of the country, at any distance from the waters
of the Atlantic, or those of the Gulf of Mexico. A specimen sent
to <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> at Philadelphia from the neighbourhood of the city of
Natchez, in the State of Mississippi, appears to have lost itself, as
during my stay in that section of the country I never heard of another;
nor have I ever met with one of these birds farther up the Mississippi
than about thirty miles from its mouths. Although rather abundant on
some parts of the coast of Florida, I found it more so along the Bay of
Mexico, particularly in Galveston Bay in the Texas, where, as well as
on the Florida Keys, it breeds in flocks. The Spoonbills are so sensible
of cold, that those which spend the winter on the Keys, near Cape Sable
in Florida, rarely leave those parts for the neighbourhood of St Augustine
before the first days of March. But after this you may find them
along most of the water courses running parallel to the coast, and distant
about half a mile or a mile from it. I saw none on any part of
the St John’s River; and from all the answers which I obtained to my
various inquiries respecting this bird, I feel confident that it never
breeds in the interior of the peninsula, nor is ever seen there in winter.
</p>

<p>
The Roseate Spoonbill is found for the most part along the marshy
and muddy borders of estuaries, the mouths of rivers, ponds, or sea
islands or keys partially overgrown with bushes, and perhaps still more
commonly along the shores of those singular salt-water bayous so
abundant within a mile or so of the shores, where they can reside
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
and breed in perfect security in the midst of an abundance of food.
It is more or less gregarious at all seasons, and it is rare to meet with
fewer than half a dozen together, unless they have been dispersed by
a tempest, in which case one of them is now and then found in a situation
where you would least expect it. At the approach of the breeding
season, these small flocks collect to form great bodies, as is the
manner of the Ibises, and resort to their former places of residence,
to which they regularly return, like Herons. During the moult,
which takes place in Florida late in May, the young of the preceding
year conceal themselves among the close branches of the mangroves
and other trees growing over narrow inlets, between secluded keys, or
on bayous, where they spend the whole day, and whence it is difficult
to start them. Toward night they return to their feeding grounds,
generally keeping apart from the old birds. In the same country the
old birds pass through their spring moult early in March, after which
they are truly beautiful, presenting the appearance which I have attempted
to represent in the plate before you. The sight of a flock
of fifteen or twenty of these full-dressed birds is extremely pleasing to
the student of nature, should he conceal himself from their view, for
then he may observe their movements and manners to advantage. Now,
they all stand with their wings widely extended to receive the sun’s rays,
or perhaps to court the cooling breeze, or they enjoy either seated on
their tarsi. Again, they all stalk about with graceful steps along the
margin of the muddy pool, or wade in the shallows in search of food.
After a while they rise simultaneously on wing, and gradually ascend
in a spiral manner to a great height, where you see them crossing
each other in a thousand ways, like so many Vultures or Ibises. At
length, tired of this pastime, or perhaps urged by hunger, they return
to their feeding grounds in a zigzag course, and plunge through
the air, as if displaying their powers of flight before you. These
birds fly with their necks stretched forward to their full length,
and their legs and feet extended behind, moving otherwise in the
manner of Herons, or with easy flappings, until about to alight,
when they sail with expanded wings, passing once or twice over the
spot, and then gently coming to the ground, on which they run a few
steps. When travelling to a distant place they proceed in regular ranks,
but on ordinary occasions they fly in a confused manner. When the
sun is shining, and they are wheeling on wing previous to alighting,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
their roseate tints exhibit a richer glow, which is surpassed only by
the brilliancy of the Scarlet Ibis, and American Flamingo.
</p>

<p>
This beautiful bird is usually fond of the company of our different
Herons, whose keen sight and vigilance are useful to it in apprising it
of danger, and allowing it to take flight in due time. When the Spoonbills
are by themselves and feeding, they can easily be approached by
those who, like yourself perhaps, are expert at crawling over the mud
on hands and knees, through the tall and keen-edged saw-grass. I
well recollect my own success when, after having seen three of these
precious birds alight on their feeding grounds, about a quarter of a
mile from where I stood, I managed after something short of half
an hour to get within shot of them. Then, after viewing them for a
while unseen, I touched one of my triggers, and two of them fell upon
the surface of the shallow water. The other might, I believe, have
been as easily shot, for it stood, as I have seen Wild Turkey cocks
do on like occasions, looking with curious intensity as it were upon its
massacred friends, until, seeing me get up and wade towards them, it
hurriedly extended its broad wings, and flew off towards the sea-shore.
When wounded in the wing, they make towards deeper water, and, if
closely pursued, will swim to some distance, but without ever attempting
to dive, and when at last seized, offer no resistance. On the contrary,
if their wings are uninjured, though they may otherwise be severely
wounded, they rise and fly to a great distance, or drop while on the
way. I have considered these birds as tough to kill, and, when on
open ground, even without being in company with Herons, as difficult
of approach. They are as nocturnal as the night Heron, and, although
they seek for food at times during the middle of the day, their principal
feeding time is from near sunset until daylight. To all such feeding
grounds as are exposed to the tides, they betake themselves when
it is low water, and search for food along the shallow margins until
driven off by the returning tide. Few birds are better aware of the
hours at which the waters are high or low, and when it is near ebb
you see them wending their way to the shore. Whenever a feeding
place seems to be productive, the Spoonbills are wont to return to it
until they have been much disturbed, and persons aware of this fact
may waylay them with success, as at such times one may shoot them
while passing over head. To procure their food, the Spoonbills first
generally alight near the water, into which they then wade up to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
tibia, and immerse their bills in the water or soft mud, sometimes
with the head and even the whole neck beneath the surface. They
frequently withdraw these parts however, and look around to ascertain
if danger is near. They move their partially opened mandibles
laterally to and fro with a considerable degree of elegance, munching
the fry, insects, or small shell-fish, which they secure, before swallowing
them. When there are many together, one usually acts as sentinel,
unless a Heron should be near; and in either case you may despair
of approaching them. I have never seen one of these birds feeding
in fresh water, although I have been told that this is sometimes
the case. To all those keys in the Floridas in which ponds have been
dug for the making of salt, they usually repair in the evening for the
purpose of feeding; but the shallow inlets in the great salt marshes of
our southern coasts are their favourite places of resort.
</p>

<p>
The Roseate Spoonbills alight on trees with as much facility as
Herons, and even walk on their large branches. They usually nestle on
the tops of the mangroves, placing their nests at the distance of a few
yards from each other. They are formed of sticks of considerable size
and are flat, like most of those of the Heron tribe. The eggs are laid
about the middle of April, and are usually three. They measure two
inches and five-eighths in length, an inch and seven-eighths in their
greatest breadth, are slightly granulated, almost equally rounded at
both ends, and have a pure white colour. I have never seen the young
when recently hatched; but when able to fly they are greyish-white.
The bill is then quite smooth, of a yellowish-green colour, as are the
legs and feet, as well as the skin on part of the head. Young birds in
their second year have the wings and the lower wing-coverts of a pale
roseate tint, the bill more richly coloured, and the legs and feet dark
brownish-red, or purplish. At this age, they are unadorned with the
curling feathers on the breast; but in the third spring the bird is perfect,
although it increases in size for several seasons after. I have never
seen one of these birds of the bright red colour assigned to them by
some authors.
</p>

<p>
While on one of the islands of Galveston Bay in Texas, I found
eight or ten nests of these birds, placed in low cactuses, amid some
hundreds of nests belonging to Herons of different species, but was not
rendered aware of the fact until I compared the eggs found there with
those procured in the Floridas, although I did at the time mention to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, and to my son, that I thought the eggs
and nests of which I speak were those of the Roseate Spoonbill and
not of the Herons. What rendered the fact doubtful, however, was,
that no Spoonbills were to be seen, as they had all betaken themselves
to flight on hearing the reports of our guns.
</p>

<p>
In connection with the procuring of some of these birds, I find a
rather curious occurrence recorded in my journal. On the 2d of May
1837, my party and I went on shore from the Revenue Cutter the
“Campbell,” on the island of Galveston, for the purpose of obtaining
fish and prawns, the latter of which are in that country extremely
abundant, and certainly the largest I have ever seen. Our fishing over,
we were on the point of returning, when we saw three Spoonbills alight
on a sand-bar, and almost immediately proceed to the water in search
of food. My son was despatched after them, and having waded through
some muddy parts of the inlet on the shore of which we were standing,
he succeeded in getting near, and killed the finest of the three. Almost
at the same instant, the back fins of a large fish, resembling those
of a shark, were seen meandering above the surface of the shallow waters.
My son received prompt intelligence of this, to enable him to make
good his return. The monster moved about rather slowly, and <span class="smcap">John</span>
having rammed home a couple of bullets, lodged them in its body, on
which it floundered about apparently in great agony. One of our boats
immediately pushed toward the spot, and my son was taken on board,
while the animal used its best efforts to get into deeper water. Now
sailors and all joined in the chase. The gun was again charged with
balls, my son waded once more towards it, and lodged the missiles in
its body, while from the bow of the boat it received several blows from
the oars and gaff-hook. The tars all leaped into the water, and the
bleeding fish was at once closely beset. The boatswain at a single
lucky stroke cut off its tail, and having afterwards fastened the hook in
one of its eyes, we dragged it to the beach. About a hundred Mexican
prisoners, Texian soldiers, and officers, were there; but instead
of our prize turning out a shark, it proved to be a sawfish, measuring
rather more than twelve feet in length. From its body we took
out alive ten young ones. It was cut into pieces by the Mexican prisoners,
and soon devoured. Five or six of the young were put into
rum, and ultimately carried to England.
</p>

<p>
The feathers of the wings and tail of the Roseate Spoonbill are manufactured
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
into fans by the Indians and Negroes of Florida; and at St
Augustine these ornaments form in some degree a regular article of
trade. Their flesh is oily and poor eating.

<p>
The affinities of this remarkable bird being variously represented
by authors, it becomes a matter of considerable interest to determine
its relations according to its internal organs. The skin is thin, but
tough, and the subcutaneous cellular tissue is largely developed. In
these respects its affinity is to the Ibises and Curlews, as much at least
as to any other birds. On the roof of the mouth are two rows of blunt
papillæ, as in many Scolopacidæ. The tongue is extremely small,
being only 3 twelfths of an inch in length, but 7 twelfths in breadth at
the base, where it is emarginate and furnished with numerous delicate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
papillæ, the outer much larger. The gular membrane is very dilatable
and of the same general nature as that of the Cormorants and Pelicans,
having a longitudinal series of muscular fibres along the centre, with
two layers of fasciculi interposed between the external skin and the
internal, the inner fasciculi running parallel to the lower mandible, the
outer transversely. The bill is similar to that of the Pelican’s modified,
the middle part or ridge being flattened, and the unguis abbreviated.
The breadth of the mouth is within <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inch. The external
aperture of the ear is roundish, 4 twelfths in diameter, that of the meatus
oblique, oblong, 3 twelfths across. The œsophagus, <i>a b</i>, is 17 inches
long (including the proventriculus, as in all the other measurements);
its diameter at the top <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch, at the distance of six inches, it contracts
to 5 twelfths, then for four inches enlarges, having its greatest diameter
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inch; between the coracoid bones it again contracts to half an inch,
and on entering the thorax enlarges to an inch. The proventriculus
is bulbiform, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch long, its glandules very large, cylindrical, the
longest being <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span> inch, and 1 twelfth in diameter. The stomach, <i>c d</i>, is a
powerful gizzard of a roundish form, 1 inch 11 twelfths long, and 1 inch
10 twelfths broad; the muscular fibres disposed in large fasciculi all
around, but not forming distinct lateral muscles; the central tendons
very large, being 10 twelfths in diameter; the cuticular lining excessively
thick, of a rather soft texture, divided by deep longitudinal irregular
fissures, its greatest thickness being about half an inch. The
intestine <i>d e f</i> is very long, measuring 8 feet <span class="mixfract">9&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches, of moderate
diameter, varying from 4 to <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths. It is compactly and beautifully
arranged in very numerous somewhat concentric folds, being coiled up
like a rope, the duodenum <i>d e</i> curving backwards and upwards over the
stomach for five inches, then returning, and enclosing the pancreas, until
under the right lobe of the liver where it receives the biliary ducts.
The cloaca is globular, 2 inches in diameter when distended; the rectum,
exclusive of the cloaca <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches, and having at its upper extremity
two bulging knobs in place of cœca. Now, the œsophagus and
proventriculus are those of a Numenius, the stomach that of a Heron
in the arrangement of its fasciculi, and in the softness of its epithelium;
but otherwise it differs in being much larger and more muscular.
The intestines are thicker and more muscular than those of
Herons, and differ more especially in having two cœcal appendages,
which however are extremely short, whereas the herons have merely
a single cœcal prominence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The heart, <i>g</i>, is remarkably large, being 1 inch and 10 twelfths long,
1 inch and a half in breadth. The lobes of the liver, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, are very large,
and about <i>equal</i>, their greatest length being 3 inches; the gall-bladder
globular, 8 twelfths in diameter. One of the testes is 11 twelfths long,
9 twelfths broad; the other 10 twelfths by 7 twelfths; their great size
being accounted for by the individual’s having been killed in the breeding
season.
</p>

<p>
In a female of much smaller size the œsophagus is 15 inches long;
the stomach 2 inches in length, 1 inch and 9 twelfths broad; the intestine
7 feet 7 inches. The contents of the stomach, fishes, shrimps,
and fragments of shells.
</p>

<p>
One of the most remarkable deviations from ordinary forms in this
bird is <i>the division of the trachea previous to its entering the thorax</i>. It may
be described as very short, a little flattened, and quite membranous,
the rings being cartilaginous and very thin. Its diameter at the top
is 5 twelfths, and it is scarcely less at the lower part, where, half-way
down the neck, is formed an inferior larynx, <i>k</i>, which is scarcely enlarged.
The two bronchi <i>lm</i>, <i>l m</i>, are in consequence excessively elongated.
They are compressed, 5 twelfths in diameter at the commencement,
gradually contracting to 3 twelfths, and enlarging a little towards the
end; and are singular in this respect that the rings of the upper fourth
are incomplete, the tube being completed by membrane in the usual manner,
whereas in the rest of their extent, the rings are elliptical, entire,
stronger, and those at the lower part united or anchylosed on the inner
side. The rings of the trachea are 105, of the two bronchi 73 and 71.
The contractor muscles are feeble and terminate at the lower larynx;
from which no muscle extends along the bronchi, which, until they
enter the thorax, run parallel and in contact, being enclosed within a
common sheath of dense cellular tissue. The bronchi have the last ring
much enlarged, and open into a funnel, which passing backwards and
terminating in one of the abdominal cells, is perforated above with
eight or ten transverse elliptical slits, which open into similar tubes or
tunnels, opening in the same manner into smaller tubes, and thus
ramifying through the lungs.
</p>

<p>
In the male bird, of which the upper part of the trachea has been
destroyed, there are in one bronchus 80, in the other 71 rings, 20 of
the upper rings being incomplete.
</p>

<p>
The vertebræ of the neck have no resemblance to those of Herons,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
nor does that part curve in the same abrupt manner; and the sternum
is in all essential respects similar to that of the Curlews, Tringas, and
other birds of that family, it having a very prominent crest, with two
deep posterior notches on each side. In fact, the sternum of Tringa
Cinclus is almost an exact miniature of it.
</p>

<p>
The compact form of the body, its great muscularity, the form of
the legs, the length and slenderness of the neck, the form and bareness
of the head, and the elongation of the bill, especially when it is laterally
viewed, all indicate an affinity to the Tantali and Numenii. But
the Spoonbills are also allied in various degrees to the Herons and Pelicaninæ;
so that they clearly present one of those remarkable centres
of radiation, demonstrative of the absurdity of quinary and circular arrangements,
founded merely on a comparison of skins.

RED-HEADED DUCK.

<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
At New Orleans, this bird is commonly known by the name of
“Dos Gris.” It arrives there in great flocks, about the first of November,
and departs late in April, or in the beginning of May. On the
lakes Borgne, St John, and Ponchartrain, it is very abundant, keeping
in large flocks, separate from the other species. In that part of the
country its food consists of small fishes, in pursuit of which it is seen
constantly diving. It is caught in different sorts of nets, and easily
kept in confinement, feeding greedily on Indian corn, whether entire
or crushed by the millstone. In 1816, many thousands of these ducks
as well as others of different species, were caught in nets by a Frenchman,
who usually sent them alive to market in cages from the narrows
of the Lakes, especially from those called “<span lang="fr">La pointe aux herbes</span>,”
and the “Isle aux pins.” So many of them, however, were procured
by this man, that he after a while gave up sending them alive, on account
of the great difficulty he encountered in procuring a sufficient
number of cages for their accommodation.
</p>

<p>
Although Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that this species breeds “in
all parts of the fur-countries, from the fiftieth parallel to their most
northern limits,” I saw none of these birds during the spring and summer
months which I spent on the coast of Labrador. I was equally
unsuccessful in my search for it in Newfoundland. Indeed, I have never
observed it eastward of the State of Massachusetts, although from
thence it is more and more abundant the farther south you proceed,
until you reach the tributaries of the Mississippi. Beyond the mouths
of that river, these birds are rarely seen; and when I was there in
April 1837, none were observed by my party or myself after we had
left the south-west Pass on our way westward. In the Texas none
were even heard of. From these circumstances I have inferred that,
along with several other species, the Red-headed Duck reaches the
Middle and Southern States by passing overland or following our
great streams, such as the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi, westward,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
and the North River, and others eastward, both in its vernal and autumnal
migrations. This I am the more inclined to believe, on account
of the great numbers which on such occasions I have seen in
ponds in the States of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
I found it abundant in the marshes near St Augustine, in East
Florida, on the 8th November 1831, when the young males of that
year had the breast and lower neck mottled with brown and blackish
feathers; and yet whilst at General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s, in that district, on
the 20th of December, they were in almost perfect plumage. At this
latter period they were shy, and kept in company with Mallards, American
Wigeons, Scaup Ducks, and Spoonbills, generally in shallow fresh-water
ponds, at some distance from the sea shore. In South Carolina,
these ducks are now much more abundant than they were twenty years
ago, especially on the Santee River, where my friend Dr <span class="smcap">Samuel Wilson</span>
Has shot many of them, as well as of the Canvass-back species.
</p>

<p>
The Red-headed Duck may be said to be equally fond of salt and
fresh water, and is found in abundance, during its stay with us, on the
Chesapeake Bay, especially in the month of March, when it associates
with the Canvass-back and other Ducks, and is offered for sale in the
Baltimore markets in great numbers. There I have seen them sold at
75 cents the pair, which was lower by 25 cents than their price at New
Orleans in April 1837.
</p>

<p>
Although they dive much and to a great depth, while in our bays
and estuaries, yet when in the shallow ponds of the interior, they are
seen dabbling the mud along the shores, much in the manner of
the Mallard; and on occasionally shooting them there, I have found
their stomach crammed with young tadpoles and small water-lizards,
as well as blades of the grasses growing around the banks. Nay, on
several occasions, I have found pretty large acorns and beech-nuts in
their throats, as well as snails, entire or broken, and fragments of the
shells of various small unios, together with much gravel.
</p>

<p>
In confinement, they do not exhibit that degree of awkwardness
attributed to them when on land. It is true that the habitual shortening
of the neck detracts from their beauty, so that in this state they
cannot be said to present a graceful appearance; yet their aspect has
always been pleasing to my sight. Their notes are rough and coarse,
and bear less resemblance to the cries of those species which are peculiar
to fresh water than those of any other of their tribe. Their flight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
is performed in a hurried manner, and they start from the water pell-mell;
yet they can continue very long on wing, and the motions of
their pinions, especially at night, produce a clear whistling sound.
</p>

The fine pair from which I made the two figures in the plate were
given me by my friend <span class="smcap">Daniel Webster</span>, Esq. of Boston, Massachusetts,
whose talents and accomplishments are too well known to require
any eulogium from me.
</p>

<p>
The flesh of this bird is generally esteemed, insomuch that many
persons know no difference between it and that of the Canvass-back
Duck, for which it is not unfrequently sold; but I look upon it as far
inferior to that of many other ducks. Individuals of both sexes vary
much in size. On comparing American with European skins, I am
unable to perceive any difference of colour or proportions indicative of
specific distinction.

<h2>
BLACK SKIMMER OR RAZOR-BILLED SHEARWATER.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Rynchops nigra</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXIII. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
This bird, one of the most singularly endowed by nature, is a constant
resident on all the sandy and marshy shores of our more southern
States, from South Carolina to the Sabine River, and doubtless also in
Texas, where I found it quite abundant in the beginning of spring.
At this season parties of Black Skimmers extend their movements eastward
as far as the sands of Long Island, beyond which however I have
not seen them. Indeed in Massachusetts and Maine this bird is known
only to such navigators as have observed it in the southern and tropical
regions.
</p>

<p>
To study its habits therefore, the naturalist must seek the extensive
sand-bars, estuaries, and mouths of the rivers of our Southern
States, and enter the sinuous bayous intersecting the broad marshes
along their coasts. There, during the warm sunshine of the winter
days, you will see thousands of Skimmers, covered as it were with their
gloomy mantles, peaceably lying beside each other, and so crowded
together as to present to your eye the appearance of an immense black
pall accidentally spread on the sand. Such times are their hours of
rest, and I believe of sleep, as, although partially diurnal, and perfectly
able to discern danger by day, they rarely feed then, unless
the weather be cloudy. On the same sands, yet apart from them,
equal numbers of our common Black-headed Gulls may be seen enjoying
the same comfort in security. Indeed the Skimmers are rarely at
such times found on sand or gravel banks which are not separated
from the neighbouring shores by some broad and deep piece of water.
I think I can safely venture to say that in such places, and at the
periods mentioned, I have seen not fewer than ten thousand of these
birds in a single flock. Should you now attempt to approach them,
you will find that as soon as you have reached within twice the range
of your long duck-gun, the crowded Skimmers simultaneously rise on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
their feet, and watch all your movements. If you advance nearer, the
whole flock suddenly taking to wing, fill the air with their harsh cries,
and soon reaching a considerable height, range widely around, until, your
patience being exhausted, you abandon the place. When thus taking
to wing in countless multitudes, the snowy white of their under parts
gladdens your eye, but anon, when they all veer through the air, the black
of their long wings and upper parts produces a remarkable contrast to
the blue sky above. Their aërial evolutions on such occasions are peculiar
and pleasing, as they at times appear to be intent on removing to a
great distance, then suddenly round to, and once more pass almost over
you, flying so close together as to appear like a black cloud, first ascending,
and then rushing down like a torrent. Should they see that
you are retiring, they wheel a few times close over the ground, and
when assured that there is no longer any danger, they alight pell-mell,
with wings extended upwards, but presently closed, and once more
huddling together they lie down on the ground, to remain until forced
off by the tide. When the Skimmers repose on the shores of the mainland
during high-water, they seldom continue long on the same spot,
as if they felt doubtful of security; and a person watching them at
such times might suppose that they were engaged in searching for
food.
</p>

<p>
No sooner has the dusk of evening arrived than the Skimmers begin
to disperse, rise from their place of rest singly, in pairs, or in
parties from three or four to eight or ten, apparently according to the
degree of hunger they feel, and proceed in different directions along
parts of the shores previously known to them, sometimes going up
tide-rivers to a considerable distance. They spend the whole night
on wing, searching diligently for food. Of this I had ample and satisfactory
proof when ascending the St John River in East Florida, in
the United States’ Schooner the Spark. The hoarse cries of the
Skimmers never ceased more than an hour, so that I could easily know
whether they were passing upwards or downwards in the dark. And
this happened too when I was at least a hundred miles from the mouth
of the river.
</p>

<p>
Being aware, previously to my several visits to the peninsula of
the Floridas and other parts of our southern coasts where the Razor-bills
are abundant, of the observations made on this species by <span class="smcap">M. Lesson</span>, 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
I paid all imaginable attention to them, always aided with
an excellent glass, in order to find whether or not they fed on bivalve
shell-fish found in the shallows of sand-bars and other places at low
water; but not in one single instance did I see any such occurrence, and
in regard to this matter I agree with <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> in asserting that, while
with us, these birds do not feed on shell-fish. <span class="smcap">M. Lesson</span>’s words are
as follows:—“<span lang='fr'>Quoique le Bec-en-ciseaux semble defavorisé par la
forme de son bec, nous acquimes la preuve qu’il savait s’en servir avec
avantage et avec la plus grande adresse. Les plages sabloneuses de
Peuce sont en effect remplies de Macetres, coquilles bivalves, que la
marée descendente laisse presque à sec dans des petites mares; le
Bec-en-ciseaux très au fait de cet phenomène, se place aupres de ces
mollusques, attend que leur valves s’entrouvrent un peu, et profite
aussitot de ce movement en enforçant la lame inferieure et tranchante
de son bec entre les valves qui se reserrent. L’oiseaux enleve alors
la coquille, la frappe sur la grève, coupe le ligament du mollusque, et
peut ensuite avaler celui-ci sans obstacle. Plusieurs fois nous avons
été temoins de cet instinct très perfectionné.</span>”
</p>

<p>
While watching the movements of the Black Skimmer as it was
searching for food, sometimes a full hour before it was dark, I have
seen it pass its lower mandible at an angle of about 45 degrees into
the water, whilst its <i>moveable</i> upper mandible was elevated a little above
the surface. In this manner, with wings raised and extended, it
ploughed as it were, the element in which its quarry lay to the extent
of several yards at a time, rising and falling alternately, and that as
frequently as it thought it necessary for securing its food when in
sight of it; for I am certain that these birds never immerse their lower
mandible until they have observed the object of their pursuit, for which
reason their eyes are constantly directed downwards like those of Terns
and Gannets. I have at times stood nearly an hour by the side of a
small pond of salt water having a communication with the sea or a bay,
while these birds would pass within a very few yards of me, then apparently
quite regardless of my presence, and proceed fishing in the
manner above described. Although silent at the commencement of
their pursuit, they become noisy as the darkness draws on, and then
give out their usual call notes, which resemble the syllables <i>hurk</i>, <i>hurk</i>,
twice or thrice repeated at short intervals, as if to induce some of their
companions to follow in their wake. I have seen a few of these birds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
glide in this manner in search of prey over a long salt-marsh bayou, or
inlet, following the whole of its sinuosities, now and then lower themselves
to the water, pass their bill along the surface, and on seizing a
prawn or a small fish, instantly rise, munch and swallow it on wing.
While at Galveston Island, and in the company of my generous friend
<span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span> and my son, I observed three Black Skimmers, which
having noticed a Night Heron passing over them, at once rose in
the air, gave chase to it, and continued their pursuit for several hundred
yards, as if intent on overtaking it. Their cries during this chase
differed from their usual notes, and resembled the barkings of a very
small dog.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Black Skimmer is perhaps more elegant than that
of any water bird with which I am acquainted. The great length of
its narrow wings, its partially elongated forked tail, its thin body and extremely
compressed bill, all appear contrived to assure it that buoyancy
of motion which one cannot but admire when he sees it on wing. It is
able to maintain itself against the heaviest gale; and I believe no instance
has been recorded of any bird of this species having been forced
inland by the most violent storm. But, to observe the aërial movements
of the Skimmer to the best advantage, you must visit its haunts
in the love season. Several males, excited by the ardour of their desires,
are seen pursuing a yet unmated female. The coy one, shooting aslant
to either side, dashes along with marvellous speed, flying hither and
thither, upwards, downwards, in all directions. Her suitors strive to
overtake her; they emit their love-cries with vehemence: you are
gladdened by their softly and tenderly enunciated <i>ha</i>, <i>ha</i>, or the <i>hack</i>,
<i>hack</i>, <i>cae</i>, <i>cae</i>, of the last in the chase. Like the female they all perform
the most curious zigzags, as they follow in close pursuit, and as
each beau at length passes her in succession, he extends his wings for
an instant, and in a manner struts by her side. Sometimes a flock is
seen to leave a sand-bar, and fly off in a direct course, each individual
apparently intent on distancing his companions; and then their mingling
cries of <i>ha</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>hack</i>, <i>hack</i>, <i>cae</i>, <i>cae</i>, fill the air. I once saw one of these
birds fly round a whole flock that had alighted, keeping at the height
of about twenty yards, but now and then tumbling as if its wings had
suddenly failed, and again almost upsetting, in the manner of the
Tumbler Pigeon.
</p>

<p>
On the 5th of May 1837, I was much surprised to find a large flock
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
of Skimmers alighted and apparently asleep, on a dry grassy part of
the interior of Galveston Island in Texas, while I was watching some
marsh hawks that were breeding in the neighbourhood. On returning
to the shore, however, I found that the tide was much higher than usual,
in consequence of a recent severe gale, and had covered all the sand
banks on which I had at other times observed them resting by day.
</p>

<p>
The instinct or sagacity which enables the Razor-bills, after being
scattered in all directions in quest of food during a long night, often at
great distances from each other, to congregate again towards morning,
previously to their alighting on a spot to rest, has appeared to me truly
wonderful; and I have been tempted to believe that the place of rendezvous
had been agreed upon the evening before. They have a great
enmity towards Crows and Turkey Buzzards when at their breeding
ground, and on the first appearance of these marauders, some dozens of
Skimmers at once give chase to them, rarely desisting until quite out
of sight.
</p>

<p>
Although parties of these birds remove from the south to betake
themselves to the eastern shores, and breed there, they seldom arrive
at Great Egg Harbour before the middle of May, or deposit their eggs
until a month after, or about the period when, in the Floridas and on
the coast of Georgia and South Carolina, the young are hatched. To
these latter sections of the country we will return, Reader, to observe
their actions at this interesting period. Were I to speak of the vast
numbers that congregate for the purpose of breeding, some of my
readers might receive the account with as little favour as they have accorded
to that which I have given of the wild pigeons; and therefore
I will present you with a statement by my friend the Rev. <span class="smcap">John
Bachman</span>, which he has inserted in my journal. “These birds are
very abundant, and breed in great numbers on the sea islands at Bull’s
Bay. Probably twenty thousand nests were seen at a time. The
sailors collected an enormous number of their eggs. The birds screamed
all the while, and whenever a Pelican or Turkey Buzzard passed near,
they assailed it by hundreds, pouncing on the back of the latter, that
came to rob them of their eggs, and pursued them fairly out of sight.
They had laid on the dry sand, and the following morning we observed
many fresh-laid eggs, when some had been removed the previous afternoon.”
Then, Reader, judge of the deafening angry cries of such a
multitude, and see them all over your head begging for mercy as it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
were, and earnestly urging you and your cruel sailors to retire and
leave them in the peaceful charge of their young, or to settle on their
lovely rounded eggs, should it rain or feel chilly.
</p>

<p>
The Skimmer forms no other nest than a slight hollow in the
sand. The eggs, I believe, are always three, and measure an inch and
three quarters in length, an inch and three-eighths in breadth. As if
to be assimilated to the colours of the birds themselves, they have a
pure white ground, largely patched or blotched with black or very dark
umber, with here and there a large spot of a light purplish tint. They
are as good to eat as those of most Gulls, but inferior to the eggs of
Plovers and other birds of that tribe. The young are clumsy, much
of the same colour as the sand on which they lie, and are not able to fly
until about six weeks, when you now perceive their resemblance to their
parents. They are fed at first by the regurgitation of the finely macerated
contents of the gullets of the old birds, and ultimately pick up the shrimps,
prawns, small crabs, and fishes dropped before them. As soon as they are
able to walk about, they cluster together in the manner of the young
of the Common Gannet, and it is really marvellous how the parents
can distinguish them individually on such occasions. This bird walks
in the manner of the Terns, with short steps, and the tail slightly
elevated. When gorged and fatigued, both old and young birds are
wont to lie flat on the sand, and extend their bills before them; and
when thus reposing in fancied security, may sometimes be slaughtered
in great numbers by the single discharge of a gun. When shot at while
on wing, and brought to the water, they merely float, and are easily
secured. If the sportsman is desirous of obtaining more, he may easily
do so, as others pass in full clamour close over the wounded bird.

In some individuals at this period, the mandibles are of equal
length.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The palate is flat, with two longitudinal series of papillæ directed
backwards. The upper mandible is extremely contracted, having internally
only a very narrow groove, into which is received the single thin
edge of the lower mandible. The posterior aperture of the nares is <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>

</p>

<p>
The œsophagus, of which only the lower portion, <i>a</i>, is seen in the
figure, is 8 inches long, gradually contracts from a diameter of 1 inch
to 4 twelfths, then enlarges until opposite the liver, where its greatest
diameter is <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">4</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>. Its external transverse fibres are very distinct, as
are the internal longitudinal. The proventriculus, <i>b</i>, is 9 twelfths

a quarter of a twelfth in length. The stomach, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, is rather small,
oblong, 1 inch 4 twelfths long, 11 twelfths broad, muscular, with the
lateral muscles moderate. The cuticular lining of the stomach is disposed
in nine broad longitudinal rugae of a light red colour, as in the
smaller Gulls and Terns. Its lateral muscles are about 4 twelfths thick,

<h2>
BONAPARTIAN GULL.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Larus Bonapartii</i>, Swains.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXIV. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
My first acquaintance with this species took place whilst I was at
Cincinnati, in the beginning of August 1819. I was crossing the Ohio,
along with Mr <span class="smcap">Robert Best</span>, then curator of the Cincinnati Museum,
for the purpose of visiting the Cliff Swallows which had taken up their
abode on the walls of the garrison on the Kentucky side, when we observed
two Gulls sweeping gracefully over the tranquil waters. Now
they would alight side by side, as if intent on holding a close conversation;
then they would rise on wing and range about, looking downwards
with sidelong glances, searching for small fishes, or perhaps eyeing
the bits of garbage that floated on the surface. We watched them
for nearly half an hour, and having learned something of their manners,
shot one, which happened to be a female. On her dropping, her mate
almost immediately alighted beside her, and was shot. There, side by
side, as in life, so in death, floated the lovely birds. One, having a dark
bluish nearly black head, was found to be the male; the other, with a
brown head, was a female. On the 12th of November 1820, I shot one
a few miles below the mouth of the Arkansas, on the Mississippi, which
corresponded in all respects with the male just mentioned.
</p>

<p>
No sooner do the shads and old-wives enter the bays and rivers of
our Middle Districts, than this Gull begins to shew itself on the coast,
following these fishes as if dependent upon them for their support, which
however is not the case, for at the time when these inhabitants of the
deep deposit their spawn in our waters, the Gull has advanced beyond
the eastern limits of the United States. However, after the first of
April, thousands of Bonapartian Gulls are seen gambling over the waters
of Chesapeake Bay, and proceeding eastward, keeping pace with
the shoals of fishes.
</p>

<p>
During my stay at Eastport in Maine, in May 1833, these Gulls
were to be seen in vast numbers in the harbour of Passamaquody at
high water, and in equal quantities at low water on all the sand and
mud-bars in the neighbourhood. They were extremely gentle, scarcely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
heeded us, and flew around our boats so close that any number might
have been procured. My son <span class="smcap">John</span> shot seventeen of them at a single
discharge of his double-barrelled gun, but all of them proved to be
young birds of the preceding year. On examining these specimens, we
found no development of the ovaries in several, which, from their smaller
size, we supposed to be females, nor any enlargement of the testes in the
males; and as these young birds kept apart from those which had brown
and black hoods, I concluded that they would not breed until the following
spring. Their stomachs were filled with <i>coleopterous insects</i>,
which they caught on the wing, or picked up from the water, into
which they fell in great numbers when overtaken by a cold fog, while
attempting to cross the bay. On the 24th of August 1831, when at
Eastport with my family, I shot ten of these Gulls. The adult birds
had already lost their dark hood, and the young were in fine plumage.
In the stomach of all were shrimps, very small fishes, and fat substances.
The old birds were still in pairs.
</p>

<p>
When exploring the Bay of Fundy, in May 1833, I was assured by
the captain and sailors, as well as the intelligent pilot of the Revenue
Tender, the Nancy, that this Gull bred in great abundance on the
islands off Grand Manan; but unfortunately I was unable to certify
the fact, as I set out for Labrador previous to the time at which they
breed in that part of the country. None of them were observed on any
part of the Gulf of St Lawrence, or on the coast of Labrador or Newfoundland.
In winter this species is common in the harbour of Charleston,
but none are seen at that season near the mouths of the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this Gull is light, elevated, and rapid, resembling in
buoyancy that of some of our Terns more than that of most of our
Gulls, which move their wings more sedately. I found the adult birds
in moult in August. Although their notes are different from those of
all our other species, being shriller and more frequent, I am unable to
represent them intelligibly by words.
</p>

<p>
Since I began to study the habits of Gulls, and observe their changes
of plumage, whether at the approach of the love season, or in autumn,
I have thought that the dark tint of their hoods was in the first instance
caused by the extremities of the feathers then gradually changing from
white to black or brown, without the actual renewal of the feathers
themselves, as happens in some species of land-birds. At Eastport, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
had frequent opportunities of seeing the black-hooded males copulating
with the brown-hooded females, so that the colour of the head in the
summer season is really distinctive of the sexes. I found in London a
pair of these birds, of which the sexes were distinguished by the colour
of the head, and which had been brought from Greenland. They
were forwarded by me to the <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of <span class="smcap">Derby</span>, in whose aviaries they
are probably still to be seen.
</p>

<p>
This is certainly the species described in the Fauna Boreali-Americana
under the same name; but it is there stated that the females
agree precisely with the males, their hood being therefore “greyish-black;”
which I have never found to be the case. As to the <i>Larus
capistratus</i> of Bonaparte’s Synopsis, I have nowhere met with a Brown-headed
Gull having the tail “sub-emarginate;” and I infer that the bird
described by him under that name is merely the female of the present
species.

<h2>
BUFFEL-HEADED DUCK.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula albeola</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
There are no portions of the Union on the waters of which this
beautiful miniature of the Golden-eye Duck is not to be found, either
during the autumnal months or in winter; and, therefore, to point out
any particular district as more or less favoured by its transient visits
would be useless. The miller’s dam is ornamented by its presence;
the secluded creeks of the Middle States are equally favoured by it as
the stagnant bayous and lakes of Lower Louisiana; in the Carolinas and
on the Ohio, it is not less frequent; it being known in these different
districts by the names of Spirit Duck, Butter-box, Marrionette, Dipper,
and Die-dipper. It generally returns from the far north, where
it is said to breed, about the beginning of September, and many reach
the neighbourhood of New Orleans by the middle of October, at which
period I have also observed them in the Floridas. Their departure
from these different portions of our country varies from the beginning
of March to the end of May. On the 11th of that month in 1833, I
shot some of them near Eastport in Maine. None of them have, I
believe, been found breeding within the limits of the Union. During
the period of their movements towards the north, I found them exceedingly
abundant on the waters of the Bay of Fundy, the males in
flocks, and in full dress, preceding the females about a fortnight, as is
the case with many other birds.
</p>

<p>
The Marrionette—and I think the name a pretty one—is a very
hardy bird, for it remains at times during extremely cold weather on
the Ohio, when it is thickly covered with floating ice, among which it
is seen diving almost constantly in search of food. When the river is
frozen over, they seek the head waters of the rapid streams, in the turbulent
eddies of which they find abundance of food. Possessed of a
feeling of security arising from the rapidity with which they can dive,
they often allow you to go quite near them, though they will then
watch every motion, and at the snap of your gun, or on its being discharged,
disappear with the swiftness of thought, and perhaps as quickly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
rise again, within a few yards as if to ascertain the cause of their
alarm. I have sometimes been much amused to see the apparent glee
with which these little Dippers would thus dive at the repeated snappings
of a miserable flint lock, patiently tried by some vagrant boys,
who becoming fatigued with the ill luck of their piece, would lay it
aside, and throw stones at the birds, which would appear quite pleased.
</p>

<p>
Their flight is as rapid as that of our Hooded Merganser, for they
pass through the air by regularly repeated beats of their wings, with
surprising speed; and yet this is the best time for the experienced
sportsman to shoot them, as they usually fly low. Their note is a
mere croak, much resembling that of the Golden-eye, but feebler. At
the approach of spring, the males often swell their throats and expand
the feathers of the head, whilst they utter these sounds, and whilst
moving with great pomposity over the waters. Often too, they charge
against each other, as if about to engage in combat, but I have never
seen them actually fighting.
</p>

<p>
When these birds return to us from the north, the number of the
young so very much exceeds that of the old, that to find males in full
plumage is much more uncommon than toward the time of their departure,
when I have thought the males as numerous as the females.
Although at times they are very fat, their flesh is fishy and disagreeable.
Many of them, however, are offered for sale in our markets.
I have often found some of them on inland ponds, which they seemed
loth to leave, for, although repeatedly shot at, they would return. Their
food is much varied according to situation. On the sea-coast, or in estuaries,
they dive after shrimps, small fry, and bivalve shells; and in
fresh-water, they feed on small crayfish, leeches, and snails, and even
grasses.
</p>

<p>
Not having found any of these birds in Labrador or Newfoundland,
I am unable to say anything as to their nests. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states,
that they frequent the rivers and fresh-water lakes throughout the Fur
Countries in great numbers, but does not mention having observed them
breeding. As in almost all other species of this family, the young of
both sexes in autumn resemble the adult female. Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> has
found this species on the streams of the Rocky Mountains, and it has
been observed as far westward as Monterey in New California.

COMMON GANNET.

<p>
On the morning of the 14th of June 1833, the white sails of the
Ripley were spread before a propitious breeze, and onward she might
be seen gaily wending her way toward the shores of Labrador. We
had well explored the Magdalene Islands, and were anxious to visit
the Great Gannet Rock, where, according to our pilot, the birds
from which it derives its name bred. For several days I had observed
numerous files proceeding northward, and marked their mode
of flight while thus travelling. As our bark dashed through the heaving
billows, my anxiety to reach the desired spot increased. At length,
about ten o’clock, we discerned at a distance a white speck, which our
pilot assured us was the celebrated rock of our wishes. After a while
I could distinctly see its top from the deck, and thought that it was
still covered with snow several feet deep. As we approached it, I
imagined that the atmosphere around was filled with flakes, but on my
turning to the pilot, who smiled at my simplicity, I was assured that
nothing was in sight but the Gannets and their island home. I rubbed
my eyes, took up my glass, and saw that the strange dimness of the
air before us was caused by the innumerable birds, whose white bodies
and black-tipped pinions produced a blended tint of light-grey. When
we had advanced to within half a mile, this magnificent veil of floating
Gannets was easily seen, now shooting upwards, as if intent on reaching
the sky, then descending as if to join the feathered masses below,
and again diverging toward either side and sweeping over the surface
of the ocean. The Ripley now partially furled her sails, and lay to,
when all on board were eager to scale the abrupt sides of the mountain
isle, and satisfy their curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Judge, Reader, of our disappointment. The weather, which hitherto
had been beautiful, suddenly changed, and we were assailed by
a fearful storm. However, the whale-boat was hoisted over, and
manned by four sturdy “down-easters,” along with <span class="smcap">Thomas Lincoln</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
and my son. I remained on board the Ripley, and commenced my
distant observations, which I shall relate in due time.
</p>

<p>
An hour has elapsed; the boat, which had been hid from our
sight, is now in view; the waves run high, and all around looks dismal.
See what exertions the rowers make; it blows a hurricane, and
each successive billow seems destined to overwhelm their fragile bark.
My anxiety is intense, as you may imagine; in the midst of my friends
and the crew I watch every movement of the boat, now balanced on the
very crest of a rolling and foaming wave, now sunk far into the deep
trough. We see how eagerly yet calmly they pull. My son stands
erect, steering with a long oar, and <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> is bailing the water
which is gaining on him, for the spray ever and anon dashes over the bow.
But they draw near, a rope is thrown and caught, the whale-boat is
hauled close under our lee-board; in a moment more all are safe on
deck, the helm round, the schooner to, and away under bare poles she
scuds toward Labrador.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Thomas Lincoln</span> and my son were much exhausted, and the sailors
required a double allowance of grog. A quantity of eggs of various
kinds, and several birds, had been procured, for wherever sufficient
room for a gannet’s nest was not afforded on the rock, one or two Guillemots
occupied the spot, and on the ledges below the Kittiwakes lay
thick like snow-flakes. The discharging of their guns produced no other
effect than to cause the birds killed or severely wounded to fall into
the water, for the cries of the countless multitudes drowned every other
noise. The party had their clothes smeared with the nauseous excrements
of hundreds of gannets and other birds, which in shooting off
from their nests caused numerous eggs to fall, of which some were procured
entire. The confusion on and around the rock was represented
as baffling all description; and as we gazed on the mass now gradually
fading on our sight, we all judged it well worth the while to cross the
ocean to see such a sight. But yet it was in some measure a painful
sight to me, for I had not been able to land on this great breeding-place,
of which, however, I here present a description given by our
pilot Mr <span class="smcap">Godwin</span>.
</p>

<p>
“The top of the main rock is a quarter of a mile wide, from north
to south, but narrower in the other direction. Its elevation is estimated
at about four hundred feet. It stands in Lat. 47° 52´. The
surf beats its base with great violence, unless after a long calm, and it
is extremely difficult to land upon it, and still more so to ascend to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
top or platform. The only point on which a boat may be landed lies
on the south side, and the moment the boat strikes it must be hauled
dry on the rocks. The whole surface of the upper platform is closely
covered with nests, placed about two feet asunder, and in such regular
order that a person may see between the lines, which run north and
south, as if looking along the furrows of a deeply ploughed field. The
Labrador fishermen and others who annually visit this extraordinary
resort of the Gannets, for the purpose of procuring their flesh to bait
their cod-fish hooks, ascend armed with heavy short clubs, in parties
of eight, ten, or more, and at once begin their work of destruction.
At sight of these unwelcome intruders, the affrighted birds rise on
wing with a noise like thunder, and fly off in such a hurried and confused
manner as to impede each other’s progress, by which thousands
are forced downwards, and accumulate into a bank many feet high;
the men beating and killing them with their clubs until fatigued, or
satisfied with the number they have slain.” Here Mr <span class="smcap">Godwin</span> assured
us that he had visited the Gannet Rock ten seasons in succession,
for the purpose just mentioned, and added, that on one of these occasions,
“six men had destroyed five hundred and forty Gannets in
about an hour, after which the party rested a while, and until most
of the living birds had left their immediate neighbourhood, for all
around them, beyond the distance of about a hundred yards, thousands
of Gannets were yet sitting on their nests, and the air was
filled with multitudes of others.  The dead birds are now roughly
skinned, and the flesh of the breast cut up in pieces of different sizes,
which will keep good for bait about a fortnight or three weeks. So
great is the destruction of these birds for the purpose mentioned, that
the quantity of their flesh so procured supplies with bait upwards of
forty boats, which lie fishing close to the Island of Brion each season.
By the 20th of May the rock is covered with birds on their nests and
eggs, and about a month afterwards the young are hatched. The earth
is scratched by the birds for a few inches deep, and the edges surrounded
by sea-weeds and other rubbish, to the height of eight or ten inches,
tolerably well matted together. Each female Gannet lays a single egg,
which is pure white, but not larger than a good-sized hen’s egg. When
the young are hatched, they are bluish-black, and for a fortnight or
more their skin is not unlike that of the common dog-fish. They gradually
become downy and white, and when five or six weeks old look
like great lumps of carded wool.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I was well pleased with this plain statement of our pilot, as I had
with my glass observed the regularity of the lines of nests, and seen
many of the birds digging the earth with their strong bills, while hundreds
of them were carrying quantities of that long sea-weed called
Eel-grass, which they seem to bring from towards the Magdalene
Islands. While the Ripley lay to near the rock, thousands of the Gannets
constantly flew over our heads; and although I shot at and brought
several to the water, neither the reports nor the sight of their dead
companions seemed to make any impression on them.
</p>

<p>
On weighing several of the Gannets brought on board, I found them
to average rather more than seven pounds; but Mr <span class="smcap">Godwin</span> assured me
that when the young birds are almost ready to fly, they weigh eight
and sometimes nine pounds. This I afterwards ascertained to be
true, and I account for the difference exhibited at this period by the
young birds, by the great profusion of food with which their parents
supply them, regardless in a great measure of their own wants. The
Pilot further told me that the stench on the summit of the rock was
insupportable, covered as it is during the breeding season, and after
the first visits of the fishermen, with the remains of carcasses of old and
young birds, broken and rotten eggs, excrements, and multitudes of
fishes. He added that the Gannets, although cowardly birds, at times
stand and await the approach of a man, with open bill, and strike furious
and dangerous blows. Let me now, Reader, assure you that unless
you had seen the sight witnessed by my party and myself that day, you
could not form a correct idea of the impression it has to this moment
left on my mind.
</p>

<p>
The extent of the southward migration of the Gannet, after it has
reared its young, is far greater perhaps than has hitherto been supposed.
I have frequently seen it on the Gulf of Mexico, in the latter part of
autumn and in winter; and a few were met with, in the course of my
last expedition, as far as the entrance of the Sabine River into the Bay
of Mexico. Being entirely a maritime species, it never proceeds inland,
unless forced by violent gales, which have produced a few such
instances in Nova Scotia and the State of Maine, as well as the Floridas,
where I saw one that had been found dead in the woods two days
after a furious hurricane. The greater number of the birds of this species
seen in these warm latitudes during winter are young of that or
the preceding year. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> has informed me that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
during one of his visits to the Sea Islands off the shores of South
Carolina, on the 2d of July 1836, he observed a flock of Gannets
of from fifty to an hundred, all of the colouring of the one in my plate,
and which was a bird in its first winter plumage. They were seen
during several days on and about Cole’s Island, at times on the sands,
at others among the rolling breakers. He also mentions having heard
Mr <span class="smcap">Giles</span>, an acquaintance of his, who knows much about birds, say,
that in the course of the preceding summer he had seen a pair of Gannets
going to, and returning from, a nest in a tree! This is in accordance
with the report of Captain <span class="smcap">Napoleon Coste</span>, who commanded
the United States Revenue Cutter, the Campbell, placed at my disposal
during my visit to the Texas, and who was Lieutenant as well as Pilot
of the Marion. He stated that he had found a breeding place on the
coast of Georgia, occupied by a flock of old, and therefore White Gannets,
the nests of all of which were placed upon trees. No one can be
greatly surprised at these reports, who knows, as I do, that the Brown
Gannet, <i>Sula fusca</i>, breeds both on trees and on dry elevated sand bars.
During winter months I have generally observed single birds at some
considerable distance from the shore out at sea, sometimes indeed beyond
what mariners call soundings, but rarely young ones, they generally
keeping much nearer to the shores, and procuring their food in shallower
water.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Gannet is powerful, well sustained, and at times
extremely elegant. While travelling, whether in fine or foul weather,
they fly low over the surface of the water, flapping their wings thirty
or forty times in succession, in the manner of the Ibis and the Brown
Pelican, and then sailing about an equal distance, with the wings at
right angles to the body, and the neck extended forwards. But, Reader,
to judge of the elegance of this bird while on wing, I would advise you to
gaze on it from the deck of any of our packet ships, when her commander
has first communicated the joyful news that you are less than
three hundred miles from the nearest shore, whether it be that of merry
England or of my own beloved country. You would then see the powerful
fisher, on well-spread pinions, and high over the water, glide
silently along, surveying each swelling wave below, and coursing with so
much ease and buoyancy as to tempt you to think that had you been
furnished with equal powers of flight, you might perform a journey of
eighty or ninety miles without the slightest fatigue in a single hour.
But perhaps at the very moment when these thoughts have crossed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
your mind, as they many times have crossed mine on such occasions,
they are suddenly checked by the action of the bird, which, intent on
filling its empty stomach, and heedless of your fancies, plunges headlong
through the air, with the speed of a meteor, and instantaneously snatches
the fish which its keen sight had discovered from on high. Now perchance
you may see the snow-white bird sit buoyantly for a while on
the bosom of its beloved element, either munching its prey, or swallowing
it at once. Or perhaps, if disappointed in its attempt, you will see
it rise by continued flappings, shaking its tail sideways the while, and
snugly covering its broad webbed feet among the under coverts of that
useful rudder, after which it proceeds in a straight course, until its
wings being well supplied by the flowing air, it gradually ascends to its
former height, and commences its search anew.
</p>

<p>
In severe windy weather, I have seen the Gannet propelling itself
against the gale by sweeps of considerable extent, placing its body almost
sideways or obliquely, and thus alternately, in the manner of Petrels
and Guillemots; and I have thought that the bird then moved
with more velocity than at any other time, except when plunging after
its prey. Persons who have seen it while engaged in procuring food,
must, like myself, have been surprised when they have read in books
that Gannets “are never known to dive,” and yet are assured that they
“have been taken by a fish fastened to a board sunk to the depth of
two fathoms, in which case the neck has either been found dislocated,
or the bill firmly fixed in the wood.” With such statements before him,
one might think that his own vision had been defective, had he not
been careful to note down at once the result of his observations. And
as this is a matter of habit with me, I will offer you mine, good Reader,
not caring one jot for what has been said to you before on the subject.
</p>

<p>
I have seen the Gannet plunge, and afterwards remain under the
surface of the water for at least one minute at a time. On one occasion
of this kind, I shot one just as it emerged, and which held a fish firmly
in its bill, and had two others half-way down its throat. This has induced
me to believe that it sometimes follows its prey in the water,
and seizes several fishes in succession. At other times I have observed
the Gannet plunge amidst a shoal of launces so as scarcely to enter the
water, and afterwards follow them, swimming, or as it were running,
on the water, with its wings extended upwards, and striking to the
right and left until it was satiated. While on the Gulf of Mexico, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
wounded a Gannet, which, on falling to the water, swam so fast before
the boat, that we rowed about a quarter of a mile before we reached it,
when it suddenly turned towards us, opened its bill, as if intent on defending
itself, but was killed with the stroke of an oar by one of the
sailors. When shot at without even being touched, these birds often
disgorge their food in the manner of Vultures; and this they always
do when wounded, if their stomach and gullet happen to be full.
Sometimes, after being wounded in the wings, they will float and allow
you to take them, without making any attempt to escape. Nay, my
young friend, <span class="smcap">George C. Shattuck</span>, M. D., of Boston, while with me
at Labrador, caught one which he found walking amongst a great number
of Guillemots, on a low and rocky island.
</p>

<p>
When they are on their favourite breeding rocks, and about to fly,
they elevate their head, throw it backward, open the bill, and emit a
loud prolonged cry, before launching themselves into the air, in doing
which they waddle a few paces with their wings partially extended.
After starting, their first motion is greatly inclined downwards, but they,
presently recover, and seem to support themselves with ease. When
they are twenty or thirty yards off, you observe them shaking the tail
sideways, and then hiding their feet among the under coverts of the tail.
At other times they suddenly open their feet, moving them as if for
the purpose of grasping some object below, in the same manner as some
hawks, but only for a few moments, when again the tail is shaken, and
the feet hidden as before. They beat their wings and sail alternately,
even when flying around their breeding places.
</p>

<p>
On the ground the movements of the Gannet are exceedingly awkward,
and it marches with hampered steps, assisting itself with the
wings, or keeping them partially open, to prevent its falling. Their
walk, indeed, is merely a hobble. When the sun shines, they are fond
of opening their wings and beating them in the manner of Cormorants,
shaking the head meanwhile rather violently, and emitting their usual
uncouth guttural notes of <i>cara</i>, <i>karew</i>, <i>karow</i>. You may well imagine
the effect of a concert performed by all the Gannets congregated for
the purpose of breeding on such a rock as that in the Gulf of St Lawrence,
where, amidst the uproar produced by the repetition of these
notes, you now and then distinguish the loud and continued wolfish
howling-like sounds of those about to fly off.
</p>

<p>
The newly-finished nest of this bird is fully two feet high, and quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
as broad externally. It is composed of seaweeds and maritime grasses,
the former being at times brought from considerable distances. Thus,
the Gannets breeding on the rocks in the Gulf of St Lawrence, carry
weeds from the Magdalene Islands, which are about thirty miles distant.
The grasses are pulled or dug up from the surface of the breeding place
itself, often in great clods consisting of roots and earth, and leaving
holes not unlike the entrances to the burrows of the Puffin. The nests,
like those of Cormorants, are enlarged or repaired annually. The
single egg, of a rather elongated oval form, averages three inches and
one-twelfth in length, by two inches in its greatest breadth, and is
covered with an irregular roughish coating of white calcareous matter,
which on being scraped off, leaves exposed the pale greenish-blue tint
of the under layer.
</p>

<p>
The birds usually reach the rock when already paired, in files often
of hundreds, and are soon seen billing in the manner of Cormorants, and
copulating on the rocks, but never, like the birds just mentioned, on the
water, as some have supposed. The period of their arrival at their breeding
grounds appears to depend much on the latitude of the place; for, on
the Bass Rock, in the Firth of Forth, which I had the pleasure of visiting
in the agreeable company of my learned friend <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span>
and his son, on the 19th of August 1835, the Gannets are first seen in
February, whereas in the Gulf of St Lawrence they rarely reach the
Great Rock until the middle of April or beginning of May; and at
Chateau Beau in the Straits of Belle Isle, not until a fortnight or three
weeks later.  Like the members of most large communities, the
Gannets, though so truly gregarious at this season, shew a considerable
degree of animosity towards their more immediate neighbours as soon
as incubation commences. A lazy bird perhaps, finding it easier to
rob the nest of its friend of weeds and sods, than to convey them
from some distant place, seizes some, on which the other resents
the injury, and some well-directed thrusts of their strong bills are
made, in open day and in full view of the assembled sitters, who rarely
fail to look on with interest, and pass the news from one to another,
until all are apprized of the quarrel.  The time however passes on.
The patient mother, to lend more warmth to her only egg, plucks a few
of the feathers from some distance beneath her breast.  In sunny
weather, she expands those of her upper parts, and passing her bill along
their roots, destroys the vile insects that lurk there. Should a boisterous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
gale or a thick cold fog mar the beauty of the day, she gathers
her apparel around her, and shrinks deeper into her bed; and should
it rain, she places her body so as to prevent the inundation of her
household. How happy, Reader, must she be when now and then her
keen eyes distinguish in the crowd her affectionate mate, as he returns
from the chase, with loaded bill, and has already marked her among
the thousand beauties all equally anxious for the arrival of their lords!
Now by her side he alights as gently as is in his nature, presents her
with a welcome repast, talks perhaps cheeringly to her, and again
opening his broad wings departs in search of a shoal of herrings. At
length, the oval chest opens, and out crawls the tender young; but lo!
the little thing is black. What a strange contrast to the almost pure
white of the parent! Yet the mother loves it, with all the tenderness
of other mothers. She has anxiously expected its appearance,
and at once she nurses it with care; but so tender is it that she prefers
waiting a while before she feeds it. The time however soon comes,
and with exceeding care she provides some well macerated morsels
which she drops into its open mouth; so well prepared are they that
there is no instance on record of a Gannet, even of that tender age,
having suffered from dyspepsia or indigestion.
</p>

<p>
The male Gannet assists in incubating, though he sits less assiduously
than the female; and, on such occasions, the free bird supplies
the other with food. The sight of the young Gannet just after
birth might not please the eye of many, for it is then quite naked,
and of a deep bluish-black, much resembling a young Cormorant.
Its abdomen is extremely large, its neck thin, its head large, its eyes
as yet sightless, its wings but slightly developed. When you look at
it three weeks afterwards, it has grown much, and almost entirely
changed its colour, for, now, with the exception of certain parts of the
neck, the short thighs, and the belly, it is covered with yellowish soft
and thick down. In this state it looks perhaps as uncouth as at first,
but it grows so rapidly that at the end of three weeks more, you find
its downy coat patched with feathers in the most picturesque manner
imaginable. Looking around you, you observe that all the young are
not of the same growth; for all the Gannets do not lay on the same
day, and probably all the young are not equally supplied with food.
At this period, the great eyrie looks as if all its parts had become
common property; the nests, which were once well fashioned are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
trampled down; the young birds stand everywhere or anywhere; lazy-looking
creatures they are, and with an appearance of non-chalance
which I have never observed in any other species of bird, and which
would lead you to think that they care as little about the present as
the future. Now the old birds are freed of part of their cares, they
drop such fish as they have obtained by the side of their young, and,
like Cormorants, Pelicans, or Herons, seldom bring a supply oftener
than once a-day. Strange to say, the young birds at this period do
not appear to pay the least attention to the old ones, which occasionally
alight near them, and drop fish for them to feed upon.
</p>

<p>
Gannets do not feed, as some have supposed, and as many have believed,
on herring only; for I have found in their stomachs codlings
eight inches in length, as well as very large American mackerels,
which, by the way, are quite different from those so abundantly met with
on the coasts of Europe.
</p>

<p>
The young never leave the spot on which they have been reared
until they are well able to fly, when they separate from the old birds,
and do not rejoin them until at least a year after. Although I have
in a few instances found individuals yet patched with dark-grey spots,
and with most of their primary quills still black, I am confident that
it is not until the end of two years that they acquire their full plumage.
I have seen some with one wing almost pure black, and the
tail of that colour also; others with the tail only black; and several
with pure black feathers interspersed among the general white plumage.
</p>

<p>
I know of no other bird that has so few formidable enemies as the
Gannet. Not one of the species of Lestris with which I am acquainted,
ever attempts to molest it; and, although I have seen the Frigate
Pelican in quest of food within a short distance of it, I never saw it
offer injury. The insular rocks on which it breeds are of course inaccessible
to quadrupeds. The only animals, so far as I know, that
feed on the eggs or young, are the <i>Larus marinus</i> and <i>Larus glaucus</i>.
It is said that the Skua, <i>Lestris Cataractes</i>, sometimes pursues the
Gannets, but that species does not exist in North America; and I am
inclined to doubt the truth of this statement, for I have never seen
a Lestris of any kind attack a bird equal to itself in size and strength.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the young Gannets are able to fly, all the birds of the
species leave the breeding place, and absent themselves until the following
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
season. While at Newfoundland, I was told that the English
and French fishermen who inhabit that country salt young Gannets for
winter provision, as is done in Scotland; but I saw none there. In my
estimation, the flesh of this bird is so bad that, as long as any other can
be procured, it ought to be rejected.
</p>

<p>
It is a curious fact, that the Gannets often procure mackerels or
herrings four or five weeks before the fishermen fall in with them on
our coast; but this is easily explained by their extensive wanderings.
Although this bird is easily kept in captivity, it is far from being a
pleasant pet. Its ordure is abundant, disagreeable to the eye as well
as the nose; its gait is awkward; and even its pale owl-like eyes glare
on you with an unpleasant expression. Add to this, the expense of its
food, and I can easily conceive that you will not give it a place in your
aviary, unless for the mere amusement of seeing it catch the food thrown
to it, which it does like a dog.
</p>

<p>
The feathers of the lower parts of the Gannet differ from those of
most other birds, in being extremely convex externally, which gives
the bird the appearance of being covered beneath with light shell-work,
exceedingly difficult to be represented in a drawing.
</p>

<p>
My highly esteemed and talented friend <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span>
having given a full account of the habits of the Gannet, as observed
on the Bass Rock in Scotland, I here present it to you.
</p>

<p>
“The Bass is an abrupt rock, having a basis of about a mile in circumference,
and of an oblong form. The cliffs are perpendicular in
some places, overhanging in others, and everywhere precipitous, excepting
at the narrow extremity next the land, where, sloping less
abruptly, they form at the base a low projection, on which is the only
landing-place. Above this are the ruins of the fortifications and houses,
the Bass having formerly been used as a State-prison. The rocks are
in some places apparently two hundred feet in height, and the summit,
towards which the surface rises in an irregular manner, is probably a
hundred and fifty feet higher. In as far as I observed, the whole mass
is of a uniform structure, consisting of trap, intermediate between
greenstone and clinkstone, of a dull brownish-red colour, and small
granular structure. Although a great portion of the upper surface of
the island is composed of rock, there is an abundant vegetation, consisting
chiefly of <i>Festuca ovina</i>, <i>F. duriuscula</i>, and a few other grasses,
mixed with the plants usually found in maritime situations.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“The circumstance connected with the Bass most interesting to the
Zoologist, is its being one of the few places in Britain to which the
Gannet resorts during the breeding season. The number which I saw
on the 13th May 1831, when I for the first time visited it along with
some friends, might be estimated at twenty thousand. Every part of
the mural faces of the rock, especially towards their summits, was more
or less covered by them. In one spot near the landing place, about
forty yards in circumference, and on a gentle slope of gravelly ground,
about three hundred individuals were sitting in peaceful security on
their nests.
</p>

<p>
“The Gannets arrive about the middle of February or the beginning
of March, and depart in October; some years a few individuals remain
during the winter. The nests are composed of grass and sea-weeds,
generally placed on the bare rock or earth, elevated in the form of a
truncated cone, of which the base is about twenty inches in diameter,
with a shallow terminal cavity.  On the summit of the island are
numerous holes in the turf, from eight to fifteen inches deep, and
from six to nine broad, formed by the Gannets in pulling away grass
and turf for their nests. They are placed on all parts of the rocks
where a convenient spot occurs, but are much more numerous towards
the summit. Some of them on the face of the rock, or in a shallow
fissure, and which have been occupied for years, are piled up to the
height of from three to five feet, but in this case they always lean
against the rock. The egg, which is solitary, and presents nothing remarkable
in its position, is of an elongated oval form, bluish-white,
dull, with a chalky surface, usually patched with yellowish-brown
dirt. It is subjected to what might appear rough usage, for the bird
in alighting, flying off, or when disturbed by the intrusion of human
visitors, tosses it about, and often stands upon it.
</p>

<p>
“When sitting, the Gannets usually allow a person to approach within
three feet, sometimes much nearer, so that one may even touch
them. When one approaches them, they merely open their bill, and
utter their usual cry, or they rise and express some degree of resentment,
but seem to have very little apprehension of danger. They take
advantage of the absence of their neighbours to pilfer the materials of
their nests, frequently two join in this act, and occasionally two may
be seen tugging at the same bunch, endeavouring to wrest it from
each other. They are constantly repairing their nests, which being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
composed in a great measure of sea-weeds, shrink up in dry weather,
and decompose in wet; and when seated close together they have frequent
quarrels. I saw one seize its neighbour by the back of the
neck, until the latter, I may say, roared out; but in general, they are
satisfied with menacing each other with open bills and loud clamour.
In leaving the nest, they generally scatter about a quantity of the materials
of which it is composed, for they are extremely awkward in their
motions when on the ground, hobbling and limping along, aiding
themselves with their wings, and draggling the abdominal feathers
and tail.
</p>

<p>
“In launching from the cliffs, they frequently utter a single plaintive
cry, perform a curve, having its concavity upwards, then shake the tail,
frequently the whole plumage, draw the feet backwards, placing them
close under the tail, on each side, and cover them with the feathers.
In some the feet were entirely covered, while in others parts of the
toes were apparent. In flying, the body, tail, neck, and bill, are nearly
in a straight line, the wings extended and never brought close to the
body, and they move by regular flappings, alternating with short sailings.
In alighting, they generally ascend in a long curve, keeping
their feet spread, and come down rather heavily, often finding it difficult
to balance themselves, and sometimes, when the place is very steep,
or when another bird attacks them, flying off, to try it a second time.
On the rocks they stand with the body nearly horizontal, or they lie
on their belly, although some may be seen in an oblique or even nearly
erect posture. They usually repose with the head resting between the
shoulders, the bill concealed among the feathers of the back. I caught
one in that state, by walking up to it, and seizing it by the tail and
the tips of the wings, which cross each other over it.
</p>

<p>
“Owing to their interference with each other, a constant noise is
kept up amongst them. Their cry is hoarse and harsh, and may be expressed
by the syllables <i>carra</i>, <i>carra</i>, <i>carra</i>, or <i>kirra</i>, <i>kirra</i>, <i>kirra</i>, or
<i>crac</i>, <i>crac</i>, <i>crac</i>. The cry varies considerably in different individuals,
some having a sharper voice than others, and when unusually irritated
they repeat it with great rapidity. An ornithological writer thinks
they cry <i>grog</i>, <i>grog</i>; but neither Mr <span class="smcap">Audubon</span> nor myself interpreted
their notes so, otherwise we could have satisfied a few at least, as we
had a bottle of whisky and a keg of water.
</p>

<p>
“The young are at first covered with very beautiful close snow-white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
down; at the age of about six weeks the feathers make their appearance
among the down; when two months old the birds are pretty well
fledged, and at the end of three months they are able to fly. The old
bird at first feeds the young with a kind of fish-soup prepared in its
gullet and stomach, and which it introduces drop by drop as it were
into its throat. But when its nursling is pretty well grown, it places
its bill within its mouth, and disgorges the fish either entire or in fragments.
They never carry fish to the rock in their bills. The smallest
number of young killed in a year is a thousand, the greatest two thousand;
but in general the number is fifteen or sixteen hundred. After
being plucked, they are sold at from sixpence to a shilling each. The
price of a young bird for stuffing is two shillings; of an old bird five,
of an egg one. For the information contained in this paragraph I am
indebted to the keeper.
</p>

<p>
“At the period of my second visit with Mr <span class="smcap">Audubon</span> (the 19th
August 1835), the nests in most places had almost entirely disappeared,
for it is only during incubation that the birds keep them in constant
repair. The young were in various stages, a few quite small and
covered all over with white down, the greater number partially fledged,
with the down remaining on the head and neck, and some nearly ready
to fly, and having merely a few tufts of down on the hind neck. The
young lay flat, either on the remnants of their nest, or on the bare rock
or ground. They are very patient and uncomplaining; in fact, none
uttered a single cry while we were inspecting them. I observed an
old bird, with its own young beside it, squeeze the neck of another
youngling with considerable force  The poor bird bore the persecution
with perfect resignation, and merely cowered under the bill of the tyrant.
The young of the latter also attacked its neighbour, but was
instantly checked, on which it meekly desisted. One of the men informed
me that last year there were fourteen nests, each with two eggs.
In such cases, one of the young is said to be much smaller than the
other.”

<p>
An adult Male killed near Boston. The cellular tissue of the back
exhibits vacuities of very large size, intervening between the skin and
the muscles: one, at the lower part of the neck behind, being 5 inches
in length; another <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, extending from the furcula down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
the humerus; and behind the wings four others, extending to the last
rib. Branches from these pass between the muscles, which present
the appearance of having been as it were dissected. A cell of enormous
size covers the side of the abdomen, and another pair run down the
middle of it, separated by a partition in the median line. That part of
the cellular tissue which adheres to the bases of the feathers is also
remarkably loose; and, close to each of them, is a roundish aperture of
large size, communicating with the great cavities mentioned above.
Between the pectoralis major and the subjacent muscles is a large interspace
formed by a great cell. The internal thoracic and abdominal
cells are also very large.
</p>

<p>
On the roof of the mouth are five sharp ridges. The nasal aperture
is 1 inch and 5 twelfths long, linear, with a soft longitudinal flap
on each side. The tongue is extremely small, being only 7 twelfths
long, 1 twelfth broad, blunt at the extremity, and with two papillae at
the base. The bare skin between the crura of the mandibles is of the
same structure as that of the Pelicans and Cormorants, but of small
extent, its posterior acute extremity not extending farther than that at
the base of the bill. The aperture of the glottis is <span class="mixfract">7&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths long.
The thyroid bone has an anterior curved prolongation, which projects
forwards, and from the extremity of which comes the elastic ligament
by which it is connected with the hyoid bone. The œsophagus, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, is 15
inches long, measured to the commencement of the proventriculus, extremely
dilated, its diameter <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches at the top, contracting to 2
inches as it enters the thorax, its narrowest part 1 inch 4 twelfths; its
transverse muscular fibres moderately strong. The proventriculus, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, is
excessively large, <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, its greatest diameter <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches. The
glandules are cylindrical, 3 twelfths long, forming a very broad belt,
separated however at its narrowest part by a longitudinal interval of 5
twelfths of an inch, and having three partial divisions on its lower
edge. The greatest length of the proventriculus, or breadth of the
belt of glandules, is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches. The mucous coat of the œsophagus is
smooth, but thrown into longitudinal plicæ when contracted; that of
the proventriculus is continuous, and of the same nature, being marked
with extremely minute reticulated lines, of which the more prominent
have a longitudinal direction. The stomach, properly so called, <i>d e</i>, is extremely
small, being only 1 inch 9 twelfths long, and about the same
breadth. Its inner coat is similar to that of the œsophagus and proventriculus; 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
being destitute of epithelium; several large mucous crypts
are scattered over its surface. The pylorus is small, having a diameter
of nearly 3 twelfths, and a marginal flap or valve on one side. The intestine,
<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, is of moderate length, measuring 53 inches. The duodenum
<i>at first passes upwards</i> in the direction of the liver for 2 inches, <i>f g</i>, is then
recurved for 3 inches, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, ascends for 4 inches, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, and receives the biliary
ducts, then passes toward the spine and forms a curvature. The average
diameter of the intestine is 5 twelfths at the upper part, and it
gradually contracts to 3 twelfths. The rectum, <i>k</i>, measured to the anus
is <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches. It gradually enlarges from 4 to <span class="mixfract">6&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths. The cloaca, <i>m</i>,
is globular, 9 twelfths long, 8 twelfths broad. The cœca are 3 twelfths
long, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfth broad.

<p>
The lobes of the liver are extremely unequal, as is always the case
when the stomach or the proventriculus is excessively large, the right
lobe being <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches long, the left 1 inch and 8 twelfths. The gall-bladder, 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
<i>n</i>, is very large, of an oblong form, rounded at both ends, 1 inch
and 8 twelfths long.
</p>

<p>
The trachea is 12 inches long, moderately ossified, round, its diameter
at the top 7 twelfths, gradually narrowing to 4 twelfths; the
rings 124, the lower 4 united, The bronchi are large, their diameter
greater than that of the lower part of the trachea; of 25 cartilaginous
half-rings. The lateral or contractor muscles of the trachea are of moderate
strength; the sterno-tracheals strong; a pair of inferior laryngeal
muscles attached to the glandular-looking, yellowish-white bodies
inserted upon the membrane between the first and second rings of the
bronchi.
</p>

<p>
The olfactory nerve comes off from the extreme anterior point of
the cerebrum, enters a canal in the spongy tissue of the bone, and runs
in it close to the septum between the eyes for 10 twelfths of an inch,
with a slight curve. It then enters the nasal cavity, which is of an irregular
triangular form, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch long at the external or palatal aperture,
10 twelfths in height. The supramaxillary branch of the fifth
pair runs along the upper edge of the orbit, and by a canal in the spongy
tissue of the bones, enters the great cavity of the upper mandible, keeping
nearer its lower surface, and there branching. This cavity appears
to have no communication with the nasal; nor has the latter any passage
towards the obliterated external nostrils. The lachrymal duct
passes obliquely inwards from the anterior corner of the eye, and enters
the nasal cavity by an aperture <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> twelfth in diameter, near its anterior
margin.
</p>

<p>
In the cloaca was found a solid calculus, half an inch in diameter,
of an irregular form, white within, externally pale yellowish-brown,
and marked with grooves impressed by the action of the sphincter ani.
</p>

<p>
The digestive and respiratory organs of the American Gannet are
thus precisely similar to those of the European. In external form,
proportions, and colours, there are no appreciable differences. The
young in all stages are similar. The flight, voice, general habits, and
all other circumstances, are the same. What, then, shall we say to those
who have pretended that the American bird differs from the European?
Merely this, compare the two, outside and inside, shew us differences,
and then we shall judge if they be sufficient to indicate different species;
but until you have done this, do not imagine that a mere “<i>Sula
Americana</i> Nob,” is enough to satisfy the world on this or any similar
point.

<h2>
SHOVELLER DUCK.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Anas clypeata</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The Creoles of Louisiana are well acquainted with this species, under
the name of “<i>Micoine</i>,” the etymology of which I am unable to
trace. In that country it arrives, both from the westward and from
the eastern inland districts, along with the Blue-winged Teal, or at the
commencement of autumn. It associates with that species, to which, as
well as to the Green-winged, the Mallard, the Dusky Duck, and the
Gadwall, I should consider it very nearly allied, notwithstanding the
peculiar expansion of its bill.  The Shovellers remain in the lower
parts of Louisiana during the whole of the winter, and depart along
with the Blue-wings between the end of April and the middle of May.
There, in early spring, they resort chiefly to ponds, where they feed on
grasses and their seeds, as well as at times a small kind of onion, the
bulbs of which they pull up from the moist grounds on their margins.
This may perhaps to some seem strange, but I have long since made
up my mind to learn from Nature, and believe what is, rather than
what philosophers imagine ought to be.  Having fed through the
night, they collect towards dawn into large bands, and betake themselves
to the margins of sand-bars on the Mississippi, where they spend
the greater part of the day. At other times I have found them swimming
or wading along the muddy margins of ponds and streams, immersing
the head and part of the neck while alternately moving the
bill to either side, in the manner of the Roseate Spoonbill, sifting as it
were the contents of the soft mud or water, and ejecting the substances
unfit for food. Repeated inspection of the stomach has shewn me that
the Shoveller is not more nice as to the quality of its food than the
Mallard or any other of the Duck tribe, for I have found in it leeches,
small fishes, large ground-worms, and snails. They never however,
I believe, feed by semi-immersion, like the Mallards and Teals, nor
do they dive unless hard pressed, or when in a sportive mood, when
they will dash for a moment beneath the surface.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This species is generally considered scarce in the United States,
and I believe it is so, for, although many pass northward and breed in
the Fur Countries, a greater number spend the summer months in the
Texas and the districts farther westward. It is however abundant on
the streams of the Rocky Mountains, as well as on the tributaries of the
Columbia River, where it was frequently observed by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>,
during summer.
</p>

<p>
We have no Ducks in the United States whose plumage is more
changeable than that of the male of this beautiful species. While the
female is sitting on her eggs, he undergoes a moult, after which he appears
mottled, and seems as if inclined to assume the garb of his partner.
From this period, the beginning of July, until late in November,
very few finely-coloured males are to be seen, and only such as have not
mated that season, in which case they do not moult until the beginning
of winter, as if to be the sooner ready to associate with females on the
approach of the next breeding season.
</p>

<p>
In the Carolinas, this species, though found during winter in the
rice fields, is not abundant; more than three or four being seldom seen
together. In our Central and Eastern Districts, they are rather rare,
and a male in full dress is not to be obtained without difficulty, although
I have seen some in the markets of New York and Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
The Shoveller walks prettily, and I have often admired its movements
in the puddles formed by heavy dashes of rain in our southern
corn-fields, where I have found it in company with the Wood Duck,
the Mallard, and the Pin-tail. Its flight resembles that of the Blue-winged
Teal; and in tenderness as well as in flavour, it rivals, as an
article of food, that beautiful bird. No sportsman who is a judge
will ever pass a Shoveller to shoot a Canvass-back. It is rarely however
found on salt water, and that only when compelled to resort
thither.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning of May, when I was in Texas, I found Shovellers
breeding in considerable numbers. The males had already left
the females, and were seen on the sand-bars of the Bay of Galveston,
up to the River St Jacinto, but none of my party discovered the nest.
During the autumn, they are to be seen on the waters adjoining the
Ohio, and generally in ponds in company with the Bald-pate or American
Widgeon, when they become very fat, and afford delicious eating.
At this time I have been often much pleased when, on perceiving a flock
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
of eight or nine of these ducks, probably members of a single family, and
cautiously approaching them, while they were busily engaged in searching
for food with their heads and necks immersed, I have obtained
several of them at the first shot, and as the survivors flew off have succeeded
in procuring one or two more. On such occasions, they rise almost
perpendicularly to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and then
fly off in a direct course, in the manner of Mallards.

into lamellæ and minute bristles, at its anterior part having a breadth
of 1 inch and terminating abruptly, but with a median thin semicircular

<p>
Long intestines, like long bills, often exhibit great differences in
the same species; for which reason characters taken from the length
of these parts must be received with latitude. Even in the Rapacious
Birds, in which the intestine is generally very short, considerable differences
are observed in individuals of the same sex and size. It will
be seen from the above statement that the Shoveller has a longer and
more slender intestine than any other American duck. In this respect
it is analogous to Pandion and Haliaetus among the Raptores; generalizing
vaguely from the consideration of which, as some have done,
one might be apt to conclude that it is more piscivorous than the
Canvass-back and Pochard, which however is by no means the case.
Although in some birds and mammalia a very elongated intestinal
canal is connected with piscivorous habits, yet many birds which feed
exclusively on fish, such as Gannets, Auks, and Guillemots, have the intestine
of only moderate length or short. It appears simply that when
for some reason resulting from the economy of the species, the intestine
must be elongated, it is made proportionally narrow; whereas if it be
expedient that it should be short, its calibre is increased.

<h2>
BLACK-NECKED STILT.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Himantopus nigricollis</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXVIII. Adult Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
A few individuals of this singular species occasionally pass the
winter in the lower parts of Louisiana, especially in the section called
Oppellousas. I have also found it at the same period in the Floridas,
but the greater number follow the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and
proceed beyond our southern limits. In April 1837, I observed their
first appearance at Galveston Bay in Texas, where many remained
until our departure. They were in small flocks, seldom composed of
more than seven or eight individuals, which almost immediately separated
into parties of two or three, and commenced their search for food.
They kept about the small shallow brackish ponds on the islands of
the bay, and now and then were observed following the sinuosities of
bayous in company with other birds. They were much more shy than
they are while breeding, and it was with some difficulty that we procured
specimens. When one was killed, the rest would fly to a considerable
distance, sometimes from one island to another, in a rapid
manner, with regular beats of the wings, their necks and legs extended.
On such occasions they uttered a whistling cry, different from the <i>cleek</i>,
<i>cleek</i>, <i>cleek</i>, which they emit when they have nests or young.
</p>

<p>
All the writers who have described the habits of this bird, allege
that it walks with a “staggering gait;” but this is by no means the
case, for they appeared to us to walk as firmly as any other long-legged
birds, such as Herons, Curlews, and the American Avoset; and I had
many opportunities of observing them, as had my friend <span class="smcap">Edward
Harris</span>, my son, and all the members of our party.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of April, flocks of this bird reach the Middle Districts,
by following the coast, for they are very rarely met with at any
great distance from the sea shore. They generally betake themselves
to extensive marshes abounding in muddy inlets and small ponds, in
the vicinity of which they usually place their nests. About the middle
of May, parties of from ten to twenty collect, and are seen wading
sometimes up to their breast, in search of food, which is extremely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
abundant in such places. They are now paired, and select suitable
spots for their nests, which are generally not far distant from each
other, and near the margins of the ponds, or on small islets. The
nest is very similar to that of the Willet, or Semi-palmated Snipe,
<i>Totanus semipalmatus</i>, being rather large, and formed of dry weeds and
the twigs of small shrubs. I have never observed the singular manner
of augmenting and raising their tenements, described by <span class="smcap">Alexander
Wilson</span>, although, like him, I have found and examined several
in the very same districts. The eggs are always four, placed
with the smaller ends together, pyriform, almost 2 inches long, with
the smaller end rounded, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> in their greatest breadth; of a pale yellowish-clay
colour, and plentifully marked with large irregular blotches
and lines of brownish-black.
</p>

<p>
While the females are sitting, the males pay them much attention,
acting in this respect like those of the American Avoset, watching the
approach of intruders, giving chase to the Red-winged Starlings, as well
as to the Fishing and American Crows, and assailing the truant young
gunner or egger. When there is no appearance of annoyance, they
sometimes roam as far as the sea-beach. When the young are hatched,
they leave the nest, and follow their parents through the grass, but on
the appearance of danger squat and remain motionless.  About the
beginning of September, young and old commence their journey southward.
</p>

<p>
This species is rather scarce along the shores of the Carolinas; nor
is it abundant in any part of the United States, and is seldom seen to
the eastward beyond Long Island. Its food consists of insects, small
crustacea, worms, and young fry of fishes. I have frequently observed
them running after flies, and attempting to seize the smaller Libellulæ.
When wounded so as to fall on the water, they are unable to dive, but
on reaching the shore they run nimbly off and hide themselves.
</p>

<p>
I feel confident that in spring the males migrate apart from the
females, but in autumn in company with them. The flesh of this species
is not decidedly good or bad, being of ordinary quality. The
males are larger than the females, and individuals of both sexes vary
considerably in size.

The Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span> has introduced into his lately published
list a species of this genus, under the name of <i>Himantopus Mexicanus</i>.
I have received from Florida two skins, which from their large size
might at first sight be thought to differ from the common kind; but
after closely comparing them with my other specimens, I can find no
difference indicative of a distinction of species. Nor have I ever met
with individuals in North America of any other species than that above
described.

<h2>
YELLOW-BREASTED RAIL.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Rallus Noveboracensis</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXIX. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
The <span class="smcap">Prince</span> of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>, who purchased one of these birds in
the New York market, in February 1826, gave a figure of it, and considered
it as an arctic species. This opinion, however, is incorrect, for
the Yellow-breasted Rail is a constant resident in the Peninsula of the
Floridas, as well as in the lower parts of Louisiana, where I have found
it at all seasons. That a few straggling individuals should proceed
northwards, advancing even to pretty high latitudes, is not much to be
wondered at, as we have a similar case in the Common Gallinule. But
at the season mentioned the individual referred to must have been forced
thither by a storm, as no Rails of any kind are found in that part
of the country in winter.
</p>

<p>
In the neighbourhood of New Orleans, this species is found in all
the deserted savannahs, covered with thick long grass, and pools of
shallow water. There you hear its sharp and curious notes many times
in the course of the day, just as you hear those of <i>Rallus crepitans</i> near
the sea-shore, more especially after the report of a gun, when they are
louder and more quickly repeated. These sounds come on the ear so
as to induce you to believe that the bird is near; but whether this be
the case or not is not easily determined, for when you move towards a
spot in which you suppose it to be, the sounds recede at your approach,
and you may think yourself fortunate if, after half an hour of search,
you discover one on wing. Indeed, if we have a bird in America
approaching in its habits the Corn Crake of Europe, it is the Yellow-breasted
Rail; and were I disposed to systematize, I should consider
it as a connecting link between land and water birds, as in some of its
habits it also resembles the European Quail, a bird as fond at times of
damp meadows bordering rivers as this species is wont to be, when it
seeks for a place of safety in which to form its nest and rear its young.
</p>

<p>
In the Floridas, this bird is more abundant than even in Louisiana;
and I met with it frequently in the course of my wanderings there, not
only on the mainland, but also on several of the keys, where they begin
breeding in March. On Sandy Island, near Cape Sable, I found several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
pairs, in May 1832. About New Orleans it commences breeding at the
same period. Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> has procured specimens near Charleston. I
have also found a few near Vincennes on the Wabash River in summer,
when they had young broods. In the course of my stay at the Silver
Springs in East Florida, I observed a good number of these birds
along the margins of the lakes and swampy bayous, and had ample
opportunities of assuring myself that this species is far from being
nocturnal, as authors have alleged, at least when in places where they
are under no apprehension of danger. In those sultry solitudes I
have at times seen them following the margins of the muddy shores,
with delicate and measured steps, until attracted by something worthy
of their attention, when they suddenly jerked their tail upwards and
for a moment disappeared. Again, they would gracefully leap upon
the slender twig of some low shrub or bush, apparently in search
of small snails or other objects, jerking their tail at every movement.
There it was that I again saw the extraordinary power of contraction
which their body is able to assume while they are pushing forward
between two or more stubborn branches. They were all so gentle
that I at times approached within a few yards of them, when they
would now and then look cunningly at me, rise more erect for a moment,
and then resume their occupations.
</p>

<p>
When searched for by a dog, they seem as if determined to put him
out by continual manœuvring, running and cutting backwards within
a few yards of extent until the dog can no longer follow the last trail.
Just then they rise on wing, or run off to some other spot equally
adapted for security. A friend of mine who resides in New Orleans,
and has shot some hundreds of this species, told me that the best method
of obtaining a shot is to lie concealed near an opening in the grass,
and call the bird out of cover by imitating its notes, when in a few
minutes, being extremely pugnacious, it comes to the clear space, and
may be easily shot. Its flesh is delicate and savoury.
</p>

<p>
The nest somewhat resembles that of <i>Rallus elegans</i>. It is generally
placed upon the ground in the centre of a thick tuft of grass,
and the bed of it is at times elevated above the soil to the height of
four or five inches. It is composed of weeds of various kinds, and
is now and then covered over in the same manner as that of our
Meadow Lark. The eggs are from eight to ten, pure white, thin-shelled,
and measure <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> inch by nearly seven eighths. The young are
at first black, and are able to follow their parents almost immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
after birth. I am induced to believe that two, or perhaps three, broods
are reared in the season.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this pretty little bird is rather swift, and more protracted
than that of some of our Rails, especially when put up by a
dog coming inadvertently upon it. At other times, when in places
not frequented, it rises and removes to a distance rarely exceeding
thirty or forty yards, falling as it were among the grass with wings
stretched upwards and dangling legs. The gizzard is large and muscular,
as in the Water-hen and our other Rails. One which I opened
was filled with minute fresh-water shell-fish and gravel. They feed
also on insects of various kinds, and the seeds of grasses.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> has so well described the notes of
this bird, that I cannot do better than present you with his account of
them. “On the 6th of October (1831), having spent the night in a
lodge, on the borders of Fresh Pond, employed for decoying and shooting
Ducks, I heard, about sunrise, the Yellow breasted Rails begin to
stir among the reeds (<i>Arundo Phragmites</i>) that thickly skirt this retired
border of the lake, and in which, among a host of various kinds of
Blackbirds, they had for sometime roosted every night. As soon as
awake, they called out in an abrupt and cackling cry, <i>’krèk</i>, <i>’krèk</i>,
<i>’krèk</i>, <i>’krèk</i>, <i>’kuk’ k’kh</i>, which note, apparently from the young, was
answered by the parent (probably the hen), in a lower soothing note.
The whole of these uncouth and guttural notes have no bad resemblance
to the croaking of the tree frog, as to sound. This call and answer,
uttered every morning, is thus kept up for several minutes in various
tones, till the whole family, separated for the night, have met
and satisfactorily recognised each other.”
</p>

<p>
I once shot a female bird of this species near New Orleans upon
which I had nearly trodden as she was on the nest and about to lay an
egg, and which she dropped as she flew before me, previously to my
touching the trigger. In August and September I have found this
species uncommonly fat, and most delicious. The difficulty of procuring
them, however, renders them a rarity for the table even in those parts
of the country where they are most abundant.
</p>

<p>
I have no doubt that a few stragglers now and then go far north to
breed, as I find in the Fauna Boreali-Americana the following note
from Mr Hutchins’s manuscripts:—“This elegant bird is an inhabitant
of the marshes (on the coast of Hudson’s Bay, near the efflux of
Severn River, where Mr Hutchins resided) from the middle of May to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
the end of September. It never flies above sixty yards at a time, but
runs with great rapidity among the long grass near the shores. In the
morning and evening it utters a note, which resembles the striking of
a flint and steel; at other times it makes a shrieking noise. It builds
no nest, but lays from ten to sixteen perfectly white eggs among the
grass.”
</p>

<p>
Now, this making no nest is to me a convincing proof that the species
is not there in its natural place, but finding itself pushed for time,
and yet obliged to breed, is contented to do so under unfavourable circumstances.
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, who spent several years in the northern
parts of America, did not meet with this species. I saw none in Labrador
or Newfoundland; and in the British provinces of New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia, the only bird of this family known is the Sora,
<i>Rallus carolinus</i>.

<h2>
AMERICAN RING PLOVER.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Charadrius semipalmatus</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXX. Male and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
I have had great pleasure in observing the migrations of this species,
particularly in early spring, when great numbers enter the southern
portions of the United States, on their way northward, where it
is now well known to breed. At that period, whatever attempts you
may make to prevent their progress, they always endeavour to advance
eastward; whereas in early autumn, they will rove in any direction,
as if perfectly aware that, the task imposed upon them by Nature having
been accomplished, they may enjoy their leisure. Those which
pass the winter within the limits of the Union, are mostly found along
the shores of South Carolina, Georgia, the Floridas, and as far south
as the mouths of the Mississippi; there being no doubt that many remain
on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, as I have found some there
early in spring, before observing those which I knew by their manners
to be recently arrived. In the course of my late visit to Texas, I
found them on Galveston Bay, where I observed some arriving from
the westward.
</p>

<p>
During their polar migration, they proceed rather swiftly, for although
they appear to touch at every place likely to afford them food
and repose, they seldom tarry long. Thus, many individuals, which
may have been in Texas early in April, not unfrequently reach Labrador
by the middle of May; although some are a month later in reaching
the ultimate point of their journey, which, according to Dr
<span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, sometimes extends as far as the Arctic Regions.
</p>

<p>
While with us in spring, they confine themselves to the sandy
beaches of our sea-coasts, whether on the mainland or on islands; but
when they arrive at their breeding stations, they abandon their maritime
life, and resort to mountainous mossy lands, as is also the custom
with several other species. On my way to Labrador, I saw some of
them in almost every place at which we landed; and when I reached
Nastasguan Bay, they were breeding in all the spots that were adapted
for that purpose.  Their manners formed an agreeable subject of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
observation to all the members of my party. As soon as one of us was
noticed by a Ring Plover, it would at once stand still and become silent.
If we did the same, it continued, and seldom failed to wear out
our patience. If we advanced, it would lower itself and squat on the
moss or bare rock until approached, when it would suddenly rise on its
feet, droop its wings, depress its head, and run with great speed to a
considerable distance, uttering all the while a low rolling and querulous
cry, very pleasing to the ear. On being surprised when in charge of
their young, they would open their wings to the full extent, and beat
the ground with their extremities, as if unable to rise. If pursued,
they allowed us to come within a few feet, then took flight, and attempted
to decoy us away from their young, which lay so close that we
very seldom discovered them, but which, on being traced, ran swiftly
off, uttering a plaintive <i>peep</i> often repeated, that never failed to bring
their parents to their aid. At Labrador, the Ring Plover begins to
breed in the beginning of June. On the 2d of July, I procured several
young birds apparently about a week old; they ran briskly to avoid
us, and concealed themselves so closely by squatting, that it was very
difficult to discover them even when only a few feet distant.
</p>

<p>
This species, like the Piping Plover, <i>Charadrius melodus</i>, forms no
nest; and whilst the latter scoops a place in the sand for its eggs, the
Ring Plover forms a similar cavity in the moss, in a place sheltered
from the north winds, and exposed to the full rays of the sun, usually
near the margins of small ponds formed by the melting of the snow,
and surrounded by short grass. Some of these pools are found on the
tops of the highest rocks of that country. The eggs, like those of all
the family, are four, and placed with the small ends together. They
are broad at the larger end, rather sharp at the other, measure <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch
in length, <span class="mixfract">7&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> inches in their greatest breadth, are of a dull yellowish
colour, irregularly blotched and spotted all over with dark brown of
different tints. The young are at first of a yellowish-grey colour, prettily
marked with darker spots on the shoulders and rump. As soon as
their parents dismissed them, they were observed searching for food
among the drying cod-fish, and along the beaches.
</p>

<p>
By the 12th of August, all the individuals which had bred in Labrador
and Newfoundland, had taken their departure, migrating southward
in company with the Phalaropes and Schintz’s Sandpipers.
Many of these birds proceed by our great lakes and rivers, they being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
sometimes seen in September along the shores of the Ohio and Mississippi.
At this period they are now and then observed on ploughed
lands, where they appear to procure different species of seeds and insects.
Along the whole extent of our Atlantic shores, they are numerous
at this season, and great numbers are killed, the flesh of the young
birds especially being juicy and tender.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is swift and sustained. They are fond of
associating with other birds of similar habits, and are generally unsuspicious,
so that they are easily approached. When on wing, their
notes are sharp, sonorous, and frequently repeated. The young members
of my party were often much amused by witnessing our pointer
chasing the old birds, whilst the latter, as if perfectly aware of the superiority
in speed, would seem to coax him on, and never failed to exhaust
him by flying along the declivities of the rocks up to their summits,
and afterwards plunging downwards to the base, thus forming
great circuits over a limited range. Their food consists of small crustacea,
mollusca, and the eggs of various marine animals. The old
males are very pugnacious in the breeding season, and engage in obstinate
conflicts, drooping their wings, and trailing their tail fully spread
out in the manner of some species of Grouse on similar occasions.

GOOSANDER.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Mergus merganser</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXXI. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
This species may be said to be a constant resident with us, as
many individuals breed in the interior of the States of New York,
Massachusetts, and Maine.  When I first resided in Kentucky,
some bred there also, although at the present day none pass the summer
in that country. In the latter part of autumn, in winter, and in
early spring, they are found in all parts of the Union; in Texas I
procured some in April 1837, and in the beginning of May saw a considerable
flock in Galveston Bay. How much farther southward their
migrations extend I know not, but from having observed them coming
from that direction, I suspect that they advance pretty far into the interior
of Mexico, from which some perhaps cross to the Arkansas
River, on which I have also seen them. On the Mississippi, the Ohio,
and their tributaries, Goosanders are found during the coldest weather;
and when the larger streams are covered with ice, they betake themselves
to such smaller creeks as have very rapid currents or cascades,
about which they feed. But there are parts of our southern coast,
where they are exceedingly rare, such as South Carolina, where my
friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> has never seen one, and the Floridas, in which
none occurred to me during my rambles there. Indeed one is surprised
to find that among birds like this, which is so hardy as to remain
in our North-eastern States during the severest part of the winter,
some should extend their movements at the same season as far to the
south-west as Texas; but facts like these are beyond our philosophy.
In the lower parts of Louisiana, this species is called the “Bee-scie-de-mer,”
probably because there it is found only on the large salt-water
lakes, and about the mouths of the Mississippi, and to distinguish
it from the Hooded Merganser, which there is more usually seen
on fresh water.  I have been assured by Professor <span class="smcap">MacCulloch</span> of
Pictou that it now and then breeds in Nova Scotia. Yet I found none
in Labrador or Newfoundland, where the Red-breasted species was
breeding in great numbers. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> found it in abundance
in the Fur Countries.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Goosander is a vigorous and robust bird. It swims deeply,
but with considerable speed, even against a strong current, running
waters being generally preferred by it, even when rather shallow, provided
their beds are of sand or pebbles, for it is rarely seen on
muddy or stagnant waters, even during the breeding season, when it
returns to the inland lakes. Like the Grebes it has the power of
sinking backwards, and it dives expertly, remaining occasionally several
minutes beneath the surface. It usually swims and dives against
the current, and close by the shores, extricating itself from floating ice
by passing under it. Its voracity is great, so that it consumes an extraordinary
quantity of fish. I have found fishes in its stomach seven
inches in length, and of smaller kinds so many as to weigh more than
half a pound. Digestion takes place with great rapidity, insomuch
that some which I have fed in captivity devoured more than two
dozen of fishes about four inches in length, four times daily, and yet
always seemed to be desirous of more. The alleged awkwardness of
this bird when on shore is a fable, for I have seen individuals while
courting in spring run with great celerity fifty or more yards at a time,
keeping nearly in an erect position. On occasions of this kind I have
observed on the sand-bars of the Mississippi flocks of seven or eight
males chasing each other with great animosity. At other times, however,
they are not fond of walking much, but when on shore are generally
seen lying flat on the ground. At times the Mergansers rise almost
at once on wing from the water, but at others they seem to find
considerable difficulty, patting it with their feet for many yards.
These differences seem to depend on various circumstances, such as
their being suddenly surprised, or during violent winds. They generally,
if not always, rise on wing against the breeze.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Goosander is powerful, and as rapid and sustained
as that of the Red-breasted and Hooded Mergansers. When fairly
under way and at a good height, they advance in an almost direct course
and proceed with surprising velocity, so that, when suddenly apprised
of the vicinity of man, they at times find it difficult to check
their speed so quickly as may be necessary for their safety. I well remember
that on several occasions having watched one of these birds
flying directly up a creek and towards me, I have taken aim at it and
fired when it was at the proper distance, and yet such had been its
velocity that it would advance, after being shot, many yards towards me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
When rising from the water, whatever number may be in the flock,
they all start together, paddle off with their feet and wings, stretching
out their necks, and thus run as it were on the water to the distance
of twenty or thirty yards with great velocity, extending in a
front, or following each other in a line, according to the extent of
the space before them. They then gradually ascend to the height of the
trees, and move off to some considerable distance, but often return to
the same place. They seem to ascertain the fertility of the water by
sipping a little on their alighting, and then, having found appearances
favourable, they open their bills, apparently to take a deep inspiration,
and immediately dive. When they have procured a sufficiency of
food, they betake themselves to some sand-bar, on which they repose
until it is digested.
</p>

<p>
The Goosander rises to the surface with the fish in its bill, and,
shifting it about until it is in a proper position, swallows it head foremost,
then dives for more. So deeply does it swim, that on such occasions
not more than a third of its body is seen on the surface; and
there is very little chance of shooting it, for it dives on seeing the flash,
or even on hearing the click of the lock. The only chance of procuring
one at such times is when, on coming to the surface, it stretches
itself up and beats its wings. If it is only wounded, it often exhibits
great tenacity of life, and diving at once remains a long time
in the water. On emerging, it is seen shaking its head violently, for
the purpose of disgorging its food, and, perhaps, the blood that has
flowed into its lungs; and, on effecting this, it again plunges headlong.
At length, you see it come to the surface, with its beautifully tinged
breast upwards; but if your object be to obtain game, you will have
little satisfaction in procuring a Goosander or any of its genus, for they
are all fishy, oily, tough, and fitted for the palate of none but experienced
epicures. The food of the Goosander consists chiefly of fish,
but also of bivalve shells, snails, leeches, aquatic lizards, crays, and
frogs.
</p>

<p>
Now, good Reader, Spring has once more gladdened the face of
Nature, pearly drops hang on every leaf, glistening in the bright sunshine,
and thousands of gay insects flutter around. My light canoe is
ready. Leap in, seat yourself snugly in the bow, and sit still while I
paddle you to the green islands of this beautiful lake, where we shall
probably find a Merganser or two, perhaps a female sitting on her eggs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
As to the dog, we need him not; so lie thee down, Baron, until I return.
I was always fond of “paddling my own canoe,” and I never
met with a single accident so long as I managed it myself; but on
more occasions than one I have been turned out as gently as one turns
himself in bed, and having put the frail bark to rights, have assisted
the awkward fellow who had caused the disaster, dived for his gun and
my own, and conducted him to the camp to dry his garments. Therefore,
be quiet, and fear nothing. See! what’s that? Nothing, friend,
but the head of a musk-rat. But look there, how swiftly swims that
beautiful Loon! Heed him not; have I not already told you all that
I know about him? How smooth and silvery are the pure waters,
how beautiful those tall trees! The dogwood is in full bloom, so are
the maples, whose rich red blossoms cluster on the twigs. Here we
are just entering the rushes of this little island. Get out, and wade to
the shore with all possible gentleness; or allow me to do so; for to
lighten our slight bark, one of us must get into the water. Softly we
advance as I pull the canoe by the bow; but now, squat, for here are
tracks of the Goosander. There now lies the female close before us.
She thinks we have not seen her, for she crouches closer upon her eggs.
Alarm her not, or she will soon depart. There she croaks, and scrambling
off through the tall grass, flies off on rapid wings. Look at the
nest! count the eggs if you choose, but allow me, if you please, to describe
them.
</p>

<p>
The islands on which the Goosander is wont to breed are mostly
small, as if selected for the purpose of allowing the sitting bird to get
soon to the water in case of danger. The nest is very large, at times
raised seven or eight inches on the top of a bed of all the dead weeds
which the bird can gather in the neighbourhood. Properly speaking,
the real nest, however, is not larger than that of the Dusky Duck, and
is rather neatly formed externally of fibrous roots, and lined round the
edges with the down of the bird. The interior is about seven and a
half inches in diameter, and four inches in depth. There are seldom
more than seven or eight eggs, which measure two inches and seven-eighths
in length, by two inches in breadth, are of an elliptical form,
being nearly equally rounded at both ends, smooth, and of a uniform
dull cream-colour. The young are led to the water in a few hours after
they are hatched, and are covered with fur-like hair, of a reddish-brown
colour about the head and neck, the body lightish grey. They are excellent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
divers, and run on the surface with surprising velocity; but
they are not able to fly for nearly two months, when, being fat, they
are easily fatigued if closely pursued, and on such occasions will often
betake themselves to the shore, lie down, and even allow you to lay
hold of them. My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> has given an interesting
account of his chase of a brood of Goosanders.
</p>

<p>
“Early in the month of May 1832, while descending the Susquehannah
near to Dunstown, a few miles below the gorge of the Alleghanies,
through which that river meanders near the foot of the Bald
Eagle Mountain, <span class="smcap">G. Lyman</span>, Esq. and myself observed, near the head
of a little bushy island, some Wild Duck, as we thought, with her
brood making off round a point which closed the view. On rowing to
the spot, the wily parent had still continued her retreat, and we gave
chase to the party, which with all the exertions that could be made in
rowing, still kept at a respectful distance before us. We now perceived
that these diminutive possessors of their natal island were a female
Goosander or Dun Diver, with a small but active little brood of
eight young ones. On pushing the chase for near half an hour, the
young, becoming somewhat fatigued, drew around their natural protector,
who now and then bore them along crowding on her back. At
length, stealing nearly from our sight, as the chase relaxed, the mother
landed at a distance on the gravelly shore, which being nearly of
her own grey colour and that of her family, served for some time, as a
complete concealment. When approached again, however, they took
to the water, and after a second attempt, in which the young strove to
escape by repeated divings, we succeeded in cutting off the retreat of
one of the family, which was at length taken from behind a flat boat
under which it had finally retreated to hide. We now examined the
little stranger, and found it to be a young Merganser of this species,
not bigger than the egg of a Goose, and yet already a most elegant
epitome of its female parent, generally grey, with the rufous head and
neck, and the rudiments of a growing crest. After suffering itself to
be examined with great calmness, and without any apparent fear, we
restored it to its more natural element, and, at the first effort, this
little diminutive of its species flew under the water like an arrow, and
coming out to the surface only at considerable distances, we soon lost
sight of it, making good its aquatic retreat in quest of the parent. On
inquiry, we learned from the tavern-keeper, that for several years past
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
a nest or brood of these birds had annually been seen near this solitary
and secluded island.”
</p>

<p>
The male Goosanders leave the females immediately after incubation
has commenced, and are then seen in the wildest parts of the
country. Several females are often found breeding on the same
island, and it is after their young are pretty well grown, that they
moult. For a number of years past, I have sometimes entertained
a hope, at the approach of the breeding season, of finding a male
Goosander having his head adorned with a broad erectile crest, like
that of the female and young, but I have hitherto been disappointed,
and am therefore unable to say whether such a crest ever exists in that
sex. The young of both sexes retain the colouring of the female for
two years, during which time the males can be distinguished from the
females only by their being much larger. The males have not the
rich buffy tint on the breast until about two years after they have commenced
breeding, and the first perceptible change by which their sex
is distinguished is the appearance of black feathers on the head and
neck. Until of late years, the females were thought to be of a distinct
species, to which the name of Dun Diver was given.
</p>

<p>
Many writers have said that this bird breeds in the hollows of
trees, or on their branches; but of the various nests which I have
found, not one occurred in such situations; and the Hooded Merganser
is the only species of this genus which I have observed nestling in an
elevated place.
</p>

<p>
The notes of the Goosander are harsh, consisting of hoarse croaks,
seldom uttered unless the bird be suddenly startled, or when courting.
The females are usually silent, but when with their young brood, and
pursued, they emit the same guttural sounds as the males. Goosanders
are easily caught with hooks baited with fish; my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>
has procured them in this manner on the Hudson River, and I also
have on the Ohio.
</p>

<p>
Along with the representation of a pair of adult birds of this species,
I have given a correct view of the Cohoes Falls in the State of
New York.

<h2>
PIED DUCK.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula labradora</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXXII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Although no birds of this species occurred to me when I was in
Labrador, my son, <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>, and the young friends who accompanied
him on the 28th of July 1833 to Blanc Sablon, found, placed
on the top of the low tangled fir-bushes, several deserted nests, which
from the report of the English clerk of the fishing establishment there,
we learned to belong to the Pied Duck. They had much the appearance
of those of the Eider Duck, being very large, formed externally
of fir twigs, internally of dried grass, and lined with down. It would thus
seem that the Pied Duck breeds earlier than most of its tribe. It is surprising
that this species is not mentioned by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> in the
Fauna Boreali-Americana, as it is a very hardy bird, and is met with
along the coasts of Nova Scotia, Maine, and Massachusetts, during the
most severe cold of winter. My friend Professor <span class="smcap">MacCulloch</span> of Pictou
has procured several in his immediate neighbourhood; and the Honourable
<span class="smcap">Daniel Webster</span> of Boston sent me a fine pair killed by himself,
on the Vineyard Islands, on the coast of Massachusetts, from which I
made the drawing for the plate before you.  The female has not, I believe,
been hitherto figured; yet the one represented was not an old bird.
</p>

<p>
The range of this species along our shores does not extend farther
southward than Chesapeake Bay, where I have seen some near the influx
of the St James River. I have also met with several in the Baltimore
market. Along the coast of New Jersey and Long Island it occurs
in greater or less number every year. It also at times enters the
Delaware River in Pennsylvania, and ascends that stream at least as
far as Philadelphia.  A bird-stuffer whom I knew at Camden had
many fine specimens, all of which he had procured by baiting fish-hooks
with the common mussel, on a “trot-line” sunk a few feet beneath
the surface, but on which he never found one alive, on account
of the manner in which these Ducks dive and flounder when securely
hooked. All the specimens which I saw with this person, male and
female, were in perfect plumage; and I have not enjoyed opportunities
of seeing the changes which this species undergoes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Pied Duck seems to be a truly marine bird, seldom entering
rivers unless urged by stress of weather. It procures its food by diving
amidst the rolling surf over sand or mud bars; although at times it
comes along the shore, and searches in the manner of the Spoonbill
Duck. Its usual fare consists of small shell-fish, fry, and various kinds
of sea-weeds, along with which it swallows much sand and gravel. Its
flight is swift, and its wings emit a whistling sound. It is usually seen
in flocks of from seven to ten, probably the members of one family.

<h2>
GREEN HERON.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea virescens</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXXIII. Male and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
This species is more generally known than any of our Herons, it
being very extensively dispersed in spring, summer, and early autumn.
It ranges along our many rivers to great distances from the sea, being
common on the Missouri and its branches, from which it spreads to all
such localities as are favourable to its habits. To the north of the
United States, however, it is very seldom seen, it being of rare occurrence
even in Nova Scotia. At the approach of winter it retires to the
Florida and Lower Louisiana, where individuals, however, reside all
the year, and many remove southward beyond the limits of our country.
I have observed their return in early spring, when arriving in flocks
of from twenty to fifty individuals. They would plunge downwards
from their elevated line of march, cutting various zigzags, until they
would all simultaneously alight on the tops of the trees or bushes of
some swampy place, or on the borders of miry ponds.  These halts
took place pretty regularly about an hour after sun-rise. The day was
occupied by them, as well as by some other species, especially the
Blue, the Yellow-crowned, and Night Herons, all of which at this period
travelled eastward, in resting, cleansing their bodies, and searching
for food. When the sun approached the western horizon, they
would at once ascend in the air, arrange their lines, and commence
their flight, which, I have no doubt, continued all night. You may
therefore, good Reader, conclude that Herons are not only diurnal habits
when feeding, but also able to travel at night when the powerful impulse
of migration urges them from one portion of the country to another.
But although on their northward journey, the Green Herons
travel in flocks, it is a curious fact, that, unlike our smaller Waders,
Ducks, Geese, and Cranes, they usually return southward at the approach
of winter, singly or in very small flocks.
</p>

<p>
Stagnant pools or bayous, and the margins of the most limpid streams,
are alike resorted to by this species for the purpose of procuring food.
It is little alarmed by the presence of man, and you may often see it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
close to houses, on the mill-dams, or even raising its brood on the trees
of gardens. This is often the case in the suburbs of Charleston in South
Carolina, where I have seen several nests on the same live oak in the
grounds of the Honourable Joel Poinset, as well as in those of other
cities of the Southern States. The gentleness, or as many would say,
the stupidity of this bird is truly remarkable, for it will at times allow
you to approach within a few paces, looking as unconcernedly upon
you as the House Sparrow is wont to do in the streets of London.
</p>

<p>
Although they not unfrequently breed in single pairs; they also associate,
not only forming communities of their own kind, but mingling
with the larger species of their tribe, and with the Boat-tailed
Grakles, and other birds. On the 23d May 1831, I found two nests of
the Green Heron on one of the Florida Keys, close to some of <i>Ardea
rufescens</i> and <i>A. cœrulea</i>. Now and then a dozen or more of their nests
are found on a bunch of vines in the middle of a pond, and placed within
two or three feet of the water; while in other cases, they place their
tenements on the highest branches of tall cypresses. In our Middle
Districts, however, and especially at some distance from the sea, it is
very seldom that more than a single nest is seen in one locality.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Green Heron, like that of almost every other species
of the tribe, is flat and composed of sticks, loosely arranged, among
which are sometimes green twigs with their leaves still attached. The
eggs are three or four, seldom more, an inch and three-eighths in length,
an inch and one-eighth in breadth, nearly equally rounded at both ends,
and of a delicate sea-green colour. According to the locality, they
are deposited from the middle of March to the beginning of June. In
the Southern States, two broods are frequently reared, but in the
Middle and Northern Districts, seldom more than one.
</p>

<p>
The young, which are at first of a deep livid colour, sparingly covered
here and there, and more especially about the head, with longish
tufts of soft hair-like down, of a brownish colour, remain in the nest
until nearly able to fly; but if disturbed, at once leave their couch, and
scramble along the branches, clinging to them with their feet, so as not
to be easily drawn off.
</p>

<p>
After the spring migration is over, the flight of this species is rather
feeble, and when they are passing from one spot to another, they
frequently use a stronger flap of their wings at intervals. On such occasions,
they scarcely contract their neck; but when travelling to a considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
distance, they draw it in like all other species of the tribe,
and advance with regular and firm movements of their wings. When
alighting to rest, they come down with such force, that their passage
causes a rustling sound like that produced by birds of prey when pouncing
on their quarry, and on perching they stretch up their neck and
jerk their tail repeatedly for some time, as they are also wont to do
on any other occasion when alarmed.
</p>

<p>
The Green Herons feed all day long, but, as I think, rarely at
night. Their food consists of frogs, fishes, snails, tadpoles, water lizards,
crabs, and small quadrupeds, all of which they procure without
much exertion, they being abundant in the places to which they usually
resort. Their gait is light but firm. During the love-season they
exhibit many curious gestures, erecting all the feathers of their neck,
swelling their throat, and uttering a rough guttural note like <i>qua</i>, <i>qua</i>,
several times repeated by the male as he struts before the female. This
note is also usually emitted when they are started, but when fairly on
wing they proceed in silence. The flesh of this species affords tolerable
eating, and Green Herons are not unfrequently seen in the markets of
our Southern cities, especially of New Orleans.
</p>

<p>
The young attain their full beauty in the second spring, but continue
to grow for at least another year. The changes which they exhibit,
although by no means so remarkable as those of <i>Ardea rufescens</i>
and <i>A. cœrulea</i>, have proved sufficient to cause mistakes among authors
who had nothing but skins on which to found their decisions. I have
given figures of an adult in full plumage, and of an immature bird, to
enable you to judge how carefully <i>Nature</i> ought to be studied to enable
you to keep free of mistakes.

BLACK-BELLIED PLOVER.

</p>


<p>
This beautiful bird makes its appearance on our southern coasts in
the beginning of April, as I had many opportunities of observing in the
course of my journey along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, in the
spring of 1837. Instead of being congregated in large flocks, as is the
case during their southward migration in autumn, they are seen coming
in small numbers, but at short intervals, so as almost to form a continuous
line. They travel chiefly by night, and rest for a great part
of the day along the margins of the sea, either reposing on the sands
in the sunshine, or searching the beaches for food. After dusk their
well-known cries give note of their passage, but by day they remain
silent, even when forced to betake themselves to flight. On such occasions
they generally wheel over the waters, and not unfrequently return
to the spot which they had at first selected. I have traced this
species along the whole of our eastern coast, and beyond it to the rugged
shores of Labrador, where my party procured a few, on the moss-covered
rocks, although we did not then find any nests, and where some
young birds were obtained in the beginning of August.
</p>

<p>
Individuals of this species spend the summer months in the mountainous
parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, where they breed.
I found their nests near the waters of the Delaware and the Perkioming
Creek, when I resided in the first of these States, and in the same localities
as those of <i>Totanus Bartramius</i>, as well as in ploughed fields.
The nest is merely a slight hollow with a few blades of grass. The
eggs are four, an inch and seven and a-half eighths in length, an inch
and three-eighths in their greatest breadth; their ground-colour yellowish-white,
tinged with olivaceous, and pretty generally covered with
blotches and dots of light brown, and pale purple, the markings being
more abundant toward the small end. Their form is similar to that
of the egg of the Guillemot, that is, broadly rounded at the large end,
then tapering, with the sides nearly straight, and the narrow end
rounded. When sitting, these birds will remain until they are almost
trodden upon. On being started, they fly off a few yards, alight running,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
and use all the artifices employed on such occasions to induce the intruder
to set out in pursuit. The young leave the nest almost immediately
after they are hatched, and should one approach them the parents become
very clamorous, and fly around until they are assured of the safety
of their brood, when they take a long flight, and disappear for a time.
Unless during the breeding season, they are exceedingly shy; but their
anxiety for their young renders them forgetful of the danger which
they incur in approaching man. The young, when two or three weeks
old, run with great celerity, and squat in perfect silence when apprehensive
of danger. When they are able to fly, several families unite,
and betake themselves to the sea-shore, where other flocks gradually
arrive, until at length, on the approach of cold weather, almost all of
them begin to move southward. Although the great body of these
Plovers pass beyond the limits of the United States, some remain on
the shores of the Floridas during winter. In their habits they are more
maritime than the Golden Plovers, which, when migrating, generally
advance over the land.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this bird is swift, strong, and well sustained. When
roaming over large sand-bars, they move in compact bodies, whirling
round, and suddenly veering, so as alternately to exhibit their upper and
lower parts. At this time old and young are intermixed, and many of
the former have lost the black so conspicuous on the neck and breast
in summer. During winter, or as long as they frequent the sea-shore,
they feed on marine insects, worms, and small shell-fish; and when
they are in the interior, on grasshoppers and other insects, as well as
berries of various kinds, on which they fatten so as to become tolerably
good eating.
</p>

<p>
This species is known in Pennsylvania by the name of Whistling
Field Plover, suggested by the loud and modulated cries which it emits
during the love-season. In the Eastern States, as well as in Kentucky,
it is called the Bull-head; but in the South its most common appellation
is Black-bellied Plover. I have seen it, though sparingly, along the
shores of the Ohio, probably during its passage from the north.
</p>

<p>
As its habits agree with those of the Plovers generally, and its form
is similar to that of the Golden Plover and other species, the only difference
being the presence of a rudimentary hind toe, it was scarcely
necessary to distinguish it generically from <i>Charadrius</i>, as many recent
authors have done.

<p>
On our arrival at the mouths of the Mississippi, on the first of
April 1837, I observed large flocks of this species on their way eastward.
They were still in their winter plumage, and it was pleasing
to see in how short a period that garb was changed, as we had opportunities
of observing during our progress. At Grande Terre, on the
4th, several having reddish feathers scattered over their lower parts
were procured. On the 13th, at Cayo Island, the change of colour was
very considerable in some specimens, which I found to be old birds,
while the younger were quite grey above, and white beneath. At
Derniere Isle on the 16th, several were shot in as fine plumage as
that represented in my plate, and few, even of the younger birds, were
without some of the markings peculiar to the summer dress. Their
numbers were exceedingly great, and continued without diminution
until we reached Galveston Bay in Texas, on the 26th of the same
month. How far they proceed beyond that place to spend the winter
I am unable to say; but their range over North America is known to
be very extensive, as they have been found on the Columbia River on
the western coast, on the borders of the great northern lakes, and over
the whole extent of the Fur Countries, from the time of their appearance
in spring until that of their return southward in autumn.
</p>

<p>
Although much more abundant along the coast, and in its vicinity,
the Red-breasted Snipe is not uncommon in many parts of the interior,
especially in autumn, and I have procured many individuals along the
muddy margins of lakes, more than three hundred miles in a direct
line from the sea. Its migratory movements are performed with uncommon
celerity, as many are observed along the coast of New Jersey
early in April, and afterwards on the borders of the arctic sea, in time
to rear young, and return to our Eastern and Middle Districts before
the end of August.
</p>

<p>
This bird exhibits at times a manner of feeding which appeared to
me singular, and which I repeatedly witnessed while at Grande Terre
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
in Louisiana. While watching their manner of walking and wading
along sand-bars and muddy flats, I saw that as long as the water was
not deeper than the length of their bills, they probed the ground beneath
them precisely in the manner of the American Snipe, <i>Scolopax
Wilsoni</i>; but when the water reached their bodies, they immersed the
head and a portion of the neck, and remained thus sufficiently long to
satisfy me that, while in this position, they probed several spots before
raising their head to breathe. On such grounds as are yet soft, although
not covered with water, they bore holes as deep as the soil will admit,
and this with surprising rapidity, occupying but a few moments in one
spot, and probing as they advance. I have watched some dozens at
this work for half an hour at a time, when I was completely concealed
from their view. Godwits, which are also borers, probe the mud or moist
earth often in an oblique direction, whilst the Woodcock, the Common
Snipe, and the present species, thrust in their bills perpendicularly.
The latter bird also seizes many sorts of insects, and at times small
fry, as well as the seeds of plants that have dropped into the water.
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that “individuals killed on the Saskatchewan
plains had the crops filled with leeches and fragments of coleoptera.”
</p>

<p>
The flight of this bird is rapid, strong, and remarkably well-sustained.
When rising in large numbers, which they usually do simultaneously,
they crowd together, are apt to launch upwards in the air
for a while, and after performing several evolutions in contrary directions,
glide towards the ground, and wend their way close to it, until
finding a suitable place, they alight in a very compact body, and stand
for a moment.  Sometimes, as if alarmed, they recommence their
meandering flight, and after a while return to the same spot, alighting
in the same manner. Then is the time when the gunner may carry
havoc amongst them; but in two or three minutes they separate and
search for food, when you must either put them up to have a good shot,
or wait the arrival of another flock at the same place, which often happens,
for these birds seldom suffer any of their species to pass without
sending them a note of invitation. It is not at all uncommon to shoot
twenty or thirty of them at once. I have been present when 127
were killed by discharging three barrels, and have heard of many
dozens having been procured at a shot. When wounded and brought
to the water, they try in vain to dive, and on reaching the nearest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
part of the shore, they usually run a few steps and squat among the
grass, when it becomes difficult to find them. Those which have
escaped unhurt often remain looking upon their dead companions, sometimes
waiting until shot at a second time. When they are fat, they
afford good eating, but their flesh is at no time so savoury as that of the
common American Snipe.
</p>

<p>
The cry of this species when on wing is a single and rather mellow
<i>weet</i>. When on the ground I have heard them emit a continued
guttural rolling sound, such as is on certain occasions given out by the
species last mentioned. Their call-note resembles the soft and pleasing
sound of a whistle; but I have never heard them emit it while
travelling. Nothing is known respecting their breeding, and yet there
can be little doubt that many of them must rear young within the
limits of the Union.

By the Creoles of Louisiana the Red-breasted Snipe is named
“Becassine de Mer,” as well as “Carouk.” In South Carolina it is
more abundant in the autumnal months than in spring, when I should
think they fly directly across from the Floridas toward Cape Hatteras,
as my friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> informs me that he never saw one of them
in spring in the vicinity of Charleston.

<h2>
YELLOW-CROWNED HERON.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea violacea</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXXVI. Adult and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
The Yellow-crowned Heron, which is one of the handsomest species
of its tribe, is called “Cap-cap” by the Creoles of Lower Louisiana,
in which country it is watched and shot with great eagerness, on
account of the excellence of its flesh. It arrives about New Orleans
toward the end of March, and departs in the middle of October. On
arriving, they throw themselves among the thickets along the bayous,
where they breed. Like the Night Heron, this species may be enticed
near by imitating its cries, when it approaches, cutting many curious
zigzags in the air, and alights close by. It is a curious circumstance
that when passing over several gunners placed on the watch for them,
they dive toward the ground if shot at and missed, and this they do
several times in succession, according to the number of shots. It is in
the evening and at dawn that they are chiefly obtained. They are
said not to travel in boisterous weather, or when there is thunder; and
I have heard the same stated with regard to the Night Heron.
</p>

<p>
In some parts of the Southern States, this species is quite abundant,
while in the intermediate tracts it is seldom or never met with.
Thus, in the Floridas, I found great numbers on a bayou near Halifax
River, but afterwards saw none until I reached one of the keys, more
than two hundred miles distant, and farther south, where it was breeding
in society. The first of these flocks I saw in winter, the other on
the 22d of May. Again, while proceeding toward the Texas, we saw
a few on an island in Bay Blanche, but met with none afterwards until
we reached Galveston Island, where they were plentiful. They seldom
advance eastward far beyond North Carolina, and I am not aware
of any having been seen farther than New Jersey. On the other hand,
they are not generally found on the Mississippi beyond Natchez, although
stragglers may sometimes be seen farther up.
</p>

<p>
This species is by no means entirely nocturnal, for I have seen it
searching for food among the roots of mangroves at all hours of the
day, and that as assiduously as any diurnal bird, following the margins
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
of rivers, and seizing on both aquatic and terrestrial animals. Whilst
at Galveston, I frequently saw a large flock similarly occupied. When
they had satisfied their hunger, they would quietly remove to some
safe distance toward the middle of an island, where, standing in a
crouching posture on the ground, they presented a very singular appearance.
That they are able to see to a considerable distance on fine
clear nights, I have no doubt, as I am confident that their migratory
movements are usually performed at such times, having seen them, as
well as several other species, come down from a considerable height in
the air, after sun-rise, for the purpose of resting and procuring food.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Yellow-crowned Heron is rather slow, and less
protracted than that of the Night Heron, which it however somewhat
resembles. When in numbers, and surprised on their perches, they
usually rise almost perpendicularly for thirty or forty yards, and then
take a particular direction, leading them to some well-known place.
Whenever I have started them from the nest, especially on the Florida
Keys, they would sneak off on wing quite low, under cover of the
mangroves, and fly in this manner until they had performed the circuit
of the island, when they would alight close to me, as if to see whether
I had taken their eggs or young.
</p>

<p>
When on the ground, they exhibit little of the elegance displayed
by the Louisiana, the Reddish, the Blue, or the White Herons; they
advance with a less sedate pace, and seldom extend their neck much
even when about to seize their food, which they appear to do with little
concern, picking it up from the ground in the manner of a domestic
fowl. Nor are they at all delicate in the choice of their viands, but
swallow snails, fish, small snakes, crabs, crays, lizards, and leeches, as
well as small quadrupeds, and young birds that have fallen from their
nests. One which was killed by my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, Esq., on
the 19th of April 1837, on an island in the Bay of Terre Blanche, about
4 o’clock in the evening, was, when opened next morning, found to have
swallowed a terrapin, measuring about an inch and a half in length, by
one in breadth. It was still alive, and greatly surprised my companions
as well as myself by crawling about when liberated.
</p>

<p>
This species places its nest either high or low, according to the nature
of the place selected for it, and the abundance of food in the neighbourhood.
In the interior of swampy woods, in Lower Louisiana, I
have found the nests placed on the tops of the loftiest cypresses, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
on low bushes, but seldom so close together as those of many other
Herons. On the Florida Keys, where I have examined more of these
tenements than in any other part, I found them either on the tops of
mangroves, which there seldom attain a greater height than twenty-five
feet, or on their lowest branches, and not more than two or three
feet from the water. In the Carolinas, they usually resort to swamps,
nestling on the bushes along their margins. The nest is similar to that
of other Herons, being formed of dry sticks loosely put together, a few
weeds, with at times a scanty lining of fibrous roots. The eggs are
generally three, never, in as far as I have seen, more, of a pale blue
colour, inclining to green, thin-shelled, and averaging two inches in
length by an inch and three and a half eighths in their greatest breadth.
The young seldom remain in the nest until able to fly, as is the case
with those of some other species, but usually leave it to follow their parents
along the shores. If scared from the nest, they scramble along
the branches with considerable agility, and hide whenever an opportunity
occurs. I have given the figure of a young bird procured in October.
</p>

<p>
The differences between the periods at which this bird breeds in
different latitudes, correspond with those observed with respect to
other species of the same tribe. Thus, eggs and young may be procured
on the Florida Keys six weeks sooner than in South Carolina,
although two broods are usually raised in both districts, the birds frequently
removing from one place to another for the purpose. The
beautiful slender plumes on the head and back generally fall off soon
after incubation commences, although I have on a few occasions found
the male still bearing these ornaments when the female was sitting on
her second set of eggs. When the young are just able to fly I have
found them good eating, but the old birds I never relished.
</p>

<p>
When wounded, the Yellow-crowned Heron defends itself vigorously
with its claws, the scratches inflicted by which are severe, and
also strikes with the bill. If not brought to the ground, in a place
where the trees are close and thickly branched, it is difficult to obtain
them without a second shot, for they scamper quickly from one twig to
another, and are very soon out of reach.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> complains that the name “Yellow-crowned” should be
given to this species, and this would almost induce me to suppose that
he had never seen one in the breeding season, when the white of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
head is strongly tinged with yellow, which however disappears at the
approach of autumn, when the bird might with all propriety be named
the White-crowned Heron.
</p>

<p>
The adult bird represented in the plate was shot by my friend Dr
<span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, a few miles from Charleston, while I was in his company;
and the drawing of the plant was made by his amiable sister-in-law,
<span class="smcap">Miss Martin</span>.

the aperture of the pylorus is extremely small, having a diameter
of only half a twelfth. The intestine is long and very slender, 6
feet 3 inches in length, its diameter at the upper part 3 twelfths; diminishing
to <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> twelfths, for about a foot from the extremity enlarged
to 5 eighths; the rectum <span class="mixfract">6&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches long; the cœcum 5 twelfths long, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
twelfth in diameter at the base, tapering to 1 twelfth, the extremity
rounded. The stomach contained fragments of crustacea.
</p>

<p>
The trachea is <span class="mixfract">8&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, cylindrical; the rings 154, and ossified;
its diameter at the top <span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths, diminishing in the space of an
inch and a half to 3 twelfths, and so continuing nearly to the end,
when it contracts to <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths. The last rings are much extended,
and divided into two portions, the last transverse half ring arched, and
5 twelfths in length. The bronchi are in consequence very wide at
the top, gradually taper, and are composed of about 25 half rings.
The contractor muscles are very feeble; the sterno-tracheal slender;
a pair of inferior laryngeal muscles inserted into the first bronchial
ring.

<h2>
AMERICAN BITTERN.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea minor</i>, Wils.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXXVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
It never was my fortune to have a good opportunity of observing
all the habits of this very remarkable bird, which in many respects
differs from most other Herons. It is a winter resident in the Peninsula
of the Floridas, as well as many of the keys or islets which border
its shores. But the greater number of individuals which pass over the
United States, on their way northward, in March, come from places
beyond our southern limits. During my residence in Kentucky, I never
saw or heard of the occurrence of one of them; and although I have
killed and assisted in killing a considerable number at various times of
the year, I never heard their booming or love-notes; or, if I have, I
did not feel assured that the sounds which reached my ears were those
of the American Bittern. This may probably appear strange, considering
the many years I have spent in searching our swamps, marshes,
and woods. Yet true it is that in all my rambles I had not the good
fortune to come upon one of these birds sitting on its eggs either
among the grass or rushes, or on the branches of low bushes, where, I
have been informed, it builds.
</p>

<p>
In Lower Louisiana, it is called the “Garde Soleil,” because they
say it will stand on one foot for hours, with its eyes, or one of them at
least, fixed on the orb of day, and frequently spread out its wings, in
the manner of Cormorants and Vultures, to enjoy the heat, or perhaps
the gentle breeze. There it is seldom obtained in spring, but is a regular
autumnal visitant, appearing early in October, and frequenting
the marshes both of fresh and salt water, where many remain until the
beginning of May. It is then common in the markets of New Orleans,
where it is bought by the poorer classes to make gombo soup. In
almost every other part of the United States it is commonly called the
“Indian Pullet,” or “Indian Hen.”
</p>

<p>
Although in a particular place, apparently favourable, some dozens
of these birds may be found to-day, yet, perhaps, on visiting it to-morrow,
you will not find one remaining; and districts resorted to one season
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
or year, will be found deserted by them the next. That they migrate
by night I have always felt assured, but that they are altogether
nocturnal is rather uncertain, for in more than half a dozen instances
I have surprised them in the act of procuring food in the middle of
the day when the sun was shining brightly. That they are extremely
timid I well know, for on several occasions, when I have suddenly come
upon them, they have stood still from mere terror, until I have knocked
them down with an oar or stick. Yet, when wounded, and their
courage is raised, they shew great willingness to defend themselves, and
if in the presence of a dog, they never fail to spread out to their
full extent the feathers of the neck, leaving its hind part bare, ruffle
those of their body, extend their wings, and strike violently at their
enemy. When seized they scratch furiously, and endeavour to bite,
so that, unless great care be taken, they may inflict severe wounds.
</p>

<p>
I never saw one of them fly farther than thirty or forty yards at a
time; and on such occasions, their movements were so sluggish as to
give opportunities of easily shooting them; for they generally rise
within a few yards of you, and fly off very slowly in a direct course.
Their cries at such times greatly resemble those of the Night and
Yellow-crowned Herons.
</p>

<p>
My friends, Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> and Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, have both heard the
love-notes of this bird. The former says, in a letter to me, “their
hoarse croakings, as if their throats were filled with water, were heard
on every side;” and the latter states that “instead of the <i>búmp</i> or
<i>böomp</i> of the true Bittern, their call is something like the uncouth syllables
of <i>’pump-aū-gàh</i>, but uttered in the same low, bellowing tone.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> procured, on the 29th April 1833, about forty miles
from Charleston, individuals, in the ovaries of which he found eggs so
large as to induce him to believe that they would have been laid in
the course of a single week. Some others which were procured by him
and myself within nine miles of Charleston, on the 29th of March,
had the eggs extremely small.
</p>

<p>
While at Passamaquody Bay, at the eastern extremity of the United
States, I was assured that this species bred in the vicinity; but I
saw none there, or in any of the numerous places examined on my way
to Labrador and Newfoundland. In neither of these countries did I
meet with a single person who was acquainted with it.
</p>

<p>
In few other species of maritime or marsh birds have I seen so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
much difference of size and weight, even in the same sex. Of about
twenty specimens in my possession, scarcely two correspond in the
length of the bills, legs, or wings. The plate before you was engraved
from a drawing made by my son <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>.

<p>
In dissecting this bird, the extreme compression of the body strikes
one with surprise, its greatest breadth being scarcely an inch and a
half, although it is capable of being much dilated.  The great
length and thickness of the neck are also remarkable; but these circumstances
are not peculiar to the present species, being equally observed
in many other Herons. On the roof of the mouth are three
longitudinal ridges; the aperture of the posterior nares is linear, with
an oblique flap on each side; the lower mandible is deeply concave,
its crura elastic and expansile; the tongue <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inches long, sagittate
at the base with a single very slender papilla on each side, trigonal,
tapering, flattened above; the width of the mouth is 10 twelfths; but the
pharynx is much wider. The œsophagus, <i>a b c</i>, which is fifteen inches
long, is very wide, having at its upper part, when inflated, a diameter
of 2 inches, but gradually contracting to <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> inch at its entrance into
the thorax, and again expanding to 1 inch. Its walls are extremely
thin, and when contracted, its mucous coat forms strongly marked longitudinal
plaits. The proventriculus is very wide, its glandules oblong
and arranged in a belt 10 twelfths in breadth. The stomach, <i>e</i>, is of
moderate size, membranous, that is with its muscular coat very thin,
and not forming lateral muscles; its tendinous spaces large and round,
its inner coat smooth and soft; its greatest diameter 1 inch. There
is a small roundish pyloric lobe, as in other Herons. Both lobes of the
liver lie on the right side of the proventriculus; one, <i>i</i>, being 1 inch 10
twelfths, the other, <i>j</i>, 1 inch 2 twelfths long; the gall-bladder large, 11
twelfths long. The intestine is long and very slender, measuring 4
feet 7 inches, with a diameter of only 2 twelfths at its upper part, and
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfth at the lower, when inflated; the rectum 4 inches long, and
4 twelfths in diameter, its anterior extremity rounded, and having a
minute papilliform termination, only 1 twelfth long.
</p>

<p>
The trachea, which is <span class="mixfract">12&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, differs from that of ordinary
Herons in being much compressed, especially at its upper and lower extremities;
the middle part being less so. It is also proportionally
wider, and its rings are narrower. At the top its diameter is 5 twelfths,
at the middle <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> twelfths, towards the lower part <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> twelfths, at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
end <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> twelfths. The rings are osseous, in number 180; the five lower
divided in front and behind, and much
arched, the last measuring half an inch in a
direct line between its extremities. The
bronchi are in consequence very broad at
their commencement, but gradually taper,
and are composed of about 18 half rings.
The contractor muscles are inconspicuous, the
sterno-tracheal slender; and there is a single
pair of inferior laryngeal, going to the first
bronchial ring. The aperture of the glottis
is 8 twelfths long, without any papillæ, but
with a deep groove behind, and two thin-edged
flaps.
</p>


<p>
In the digestive organs of this bird, there
is nothing remarkably different from that of
other Herons. The stomach contained remains
of fishes and large coleopterous insects.
The examination of the trachea, bronchi,
and lungs, would not lead us to suppose
that its cry is of the curious character represented,
although it certainly would induce
us to believe it different from that of ordinary
Herons, which have the trachea narrower,
round, and with broader and more
bony rings.
</p>

<p>
Although in external appearance and habits
it exhibits some affinity to the Rails,
its digestive organs have no resemblance to
theirs.

An egg presented by Dr <span class="smcap">Brewer</span> of Boston measures two inches in

<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXXVIII. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
The beautiful Duck from which I made the drawing copied on the
plate before you, was shot on Lake Barataria, in Louisiana, in February
1822. It was in company with seven or eight Canvass-back
Ducks. No other individuals of the species were in sight at the time,
and all my efforts to procure another have been ineffectual.
</p>

<p>
You will see that this curious bird is named in the plate “<i>Anas
glocitans</i>,” the descriptions of that species having induced me to consider
it identical with this. But on comparing my drawing with specimens
in the Museum of the Zoological Society of London, I found
that the former represents a much larger bird, which, besides, is differently
coloured in some of its parts. The individual figured was a
male; but I have some doubts whether it had acquired the full beauty
of its mature plumage, and I considered it at the time as a bird of the
preceding season.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In form and proportions this bird is very nearly allied to the Mallard,
from which it differs in having the bill considerably narrower, in
wanting the recurved feathers of the tail, in having the feet dull
yellow in place of orange-red, the speculum more green and duller,
without the white bands of that bird, and in the large patch of light
red on the side of the head. It may possibly be an accidental variety,
or a hybrid between that bird and some other species, perhaps the
Gadwall, to which also it bears a great resemblance.
</p>

<p>
Bill nearly as long as the head, higher than broad at the base, depressed
and widened towards the end, rounded at the tip, the lamellæ
short and numerous, the unguis obovate, curved, the nasal groove elliptical,
the nostrils oblong.
</p>

<p>
Head of moderate size, oblong, compressed; neck rather long and
slender; body full, depressed. Feet short, stout, placed behind the
centre of the body; legs bare a little above the joint; tarsus short, a
little compressed, anteriorly with small scutella, laterally and behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
with reticulated angular scales. Hind toe very small, with a narrow
free membrane; third toe longest, fourth a little shorter; claws small,
arched, compressed, acute.
</p>

<p>
Plumage dense, soft, and elastic; of the hind head and neck short
and blended; of the other parts in general broad and rounded. Wings
of moderate length, acute; tail short, graduated.

<p>
Bill dull yellow, slightly tinged with green, dusky along the ridge.
Iris brown. Feet dull yellow, claws dusky, webs dull grey. Head
and upper part of the neck deep glossy green; but there is an elongated
patch of pale reddish-yellow, extending from the base of the bill
over the cheek to two inches and a quarter behind the eye, and meeting
that of the other side on the chin; the space immediately over and
behind the eye light dull purple. A narrow ring of pale yellowish-red
on the middle of the neck; the lower part of the neck dull brownish-red,
the feathers with a transverse band of dusky, and edged with
paler. The upper parts are dull greyish-brown, transversely undulated
with dusky; the smaller wing-coverts without undulations, but each
feather with a dusky bar behind another of light dull yellow; first row
of smaller coverts tipped with black; primaries and their coverts, light
brownish-grey; some of the outer secondaries similar, the next five or
six duck-green, the next light grey with a dusky patch toward the end.
The rump and upper tail-coverts black, as are the parts under the tail,
excepting two longitudinal white bands; tail-feathers light brownish-grey,
edged with whitish. All the rest of the lower parts are greyish-white
tinged with yellow, beautifully undulated with dusky lines, on
the middle of the breast these lines less numerous, and each feather
with a reddish-grey central streak.

<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXXXIX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
This interesting little bird sometimes makes its appearance on our
eastern coasts during very cold and stormy weather. It does not proceed
much farther southward than the shores of New Jersey, where it
is of very rare occurrence. Now and then some are caught in a state
of exhaustion, as I have known to be the case especially in Passamaquody
Bay near Eastport in Maine, and in the vicinity of Boston and
Salem in Massachusetts.
</p>

<p>
In the course of my voyages across the Atlantic, I have often observed
the Little Guillemots in small groups, rising and flying to short
distances at the approach of the ship, or diving close to the bow and reappearing
a little way behind. Now with expanded wings they would
flutter and run as it were on the surface of the deep; again, they would
seem to be busily engaged in procuring food, which consisted apparently
of shrimps, other crustacea, and particles of sea-weeds, all of which
I have found in their stomach. I have often thought how easy it
would be to catch these tiny wanderers of the ocean with nets thrown
expertly from the bow of a boat, for they manifest very little apprehension
of danger from the proximity of one, insomuch that I have
seen several killed with the oars. Those which were caught alive and
placed on the deck, would at first rest a few minutes with their bodies
flat, then rise upright and run about briskly, or attempt to fly off,
which they sometimes accomplished, when they happened to go in a
straight course the whole length of the ship so as to rise easily over
the bulwarks. On effecting their escape they would alight on the
water and immediately disappear.
</p>

<p>
During my visit to Labrador and Newfoundland I met with none
of these birds, although the cod-fishers assured me that they frequently
breed there. I am informed by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> that this species is
found near the mouth of the Columbia River.

There is nothing very remarkable in the anatomy of this bird, beyond
what is observed in the Auks and Guillemots. The ribs extend
very far back, and, having the dorsal and sternal portions much elongated,

of which the internal, or thoracic and abdominal cells are very large.
The subcutaneous cells are also largely developed, as in many other
diving and plunging birds.

The roof of the mouth is flat, broad, and covered with numerous
series of short horny papillæ directed backwards. The tongue is large,
fleshy, 10 twelfths of an inch long, emarginate at the base, flat above,

The œsophagus, Fig. 1, <i>a b c</i>, is 3 inches 10 twelfths long, its walls
very thin, its inner or mucous coat thrown into longitudinal plates; its
diameter at the middle of the neck 5 eighths, diminishing to 4 twelfths
as it enters the thorax. It then enlarges and forms the proventriculus,
<i>c e</i>, which has a diameter of 8 twelfths; the glandules are cylindrical,
very numerous, and arranged in a complete belt, half an inch in breadth,
in the usual manner, as seen in Fig. 2, <i>b c</i>. The stomach, properly so
called, Fig. 1, <i>d g</i>, is oblong, 11 twelfths in length, 8 twelfths in breadth;
its muscular coat moderately thick, and disposed into two lateral muscles
with large tendons; its epithelium, Fig. 2, <i>c d e</i>, thick, hard, with numerous
longitudinal and transverse rugæ, and of a dark reddish colour.

<p>
The above account of the digestive organs of this bird will be seen
to be very different from that given by Sir Everard Home, who has, in
all probability, mistaken the species. “There is still,” says he, “one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
more variety in the structure of the digestive organs of birds, that live
principally upon animal food, which has come under my observation;
and with an account of which I shall conclude the present lecture.
This bird is the Alea Alle of Linnæus, the Little Auk. The termination
of the œsophagus is only known by the ending of the cuticular
lining, and the beginning of the gastric glands; for the cardiac cavity
is one continued tube, extending considerably lower down in the cavity
of the abdomen, and gradually enlarging at the lower part; it then
turns up to the right side, about half-way to the origin of the cavity,
and is there connected to a small gizzard, the digastric muscle of which
is strong, and a small portion of the internal surface on each side has
a hard cuticular covering. The gastric glands at the upper part are
placed in four distinct longitudinal rows, becoming more and more numerous
towards the lower part of the cavity, and extend to the bottom,
where it turns up. The extent of the cavity in which the gastric
glands are placed, exceeds any thing met with in the other birds that
live upon fish; and the turn which the cavity takes almost directly upwards,
and the gizzard being at the highest part instead of the lowest,
are peculiarities, as far as I am acquainted, not met with in any other
birds of prey. This mechanism, which will be better understood by
examining the engraving, makes the obstacles to the food in its passage
to the intestines unusually great; and enables the bird to digest both
fishes and sea-worms with crustaceous shells. It appears to be given
for the purpose of economizing the food in two different ways,—one
retaining it longer in the cardiac cavity, the other supplying that cavity
with a greater quantity of gastric liquor than in other birds. This
opinion is further confirmed by the habits of life of this particular species
of bird, which spends a portion of the year in the frozen regions
of Nova Zembla, where the supplies of nourishment must be both
scanty and precarious.”
</p>


<p>
With respect to this statement and the reasonings founded upon it,
it will be seen from the description and accompanying figures above,
taken directly from nature, and without the least reference to the dissections
or theories of any person, that the œsophagus and stomach of the
Little Auk or Guillemot, <i>Alca Alle</i> of Linnæus, are very similar to those
of other Auks, Guillemots, Divers, and fish-eating birds in general.
The cardiac or proventricular cavity forms no curve; and the gizzard
with which it is connected, is not small, nor has it merely a small portion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
of the internal surface on each side covered with a hard cuticular
lining; for the epithelium covers its whole surface, and is of considerable
extent. The gastric glands are not at all disposed as represented
by Sir <span class="smcap">E. Home</span>, but are aggregated in the form of a compact belt half
an inch broad, Fig. 2. <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>. As to the ingenious reasoning by which
the economy of the Little Auk is so satisfactorily accounted for, it is
enough here to say, that having no foundation, it is of less than no
value. But were there such a curvature as that in question, there
could be no propriety in supposing that it presented any great obstacle
to the passage of the food, or retained it longer than usual. Nor is
the statement as to scanty and precarious supply of nourishment correct;
for the Arctic Seas, to which this bird resorts in vast numbers,
are represented by navigators as abounding in small crustacea, on which
chiefly the Little Auk feeds, and that to such an extent as to colour
the water for leagues. Besides, if there were such a scarcity of food
in Nova Zembla, why should the birds go there? In short, the whole
statement is incorrect; and the many compilers, from Dr <span class="smcap">Carus</span> to
the most recent, who have pressed it into their service, may, in their
future editions, with propriety leave it out, and supply its place with
something equally ingenious.
</p>

<p>
The egg of this species measures one inch and nearly five-eighths
in length, one inch and an eighth in its greatest breadth. It is remarkably
large for the size of the bird, and of a dull uniform pale
greenish-blue.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Thalassidroma pelagica</i>, Leach.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXL. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
In August 1830, being becalmed on the banks of Newfoundland,
I obtained several individuals of this species from a flock composed
chiefly of <i>Thalassidroma Leachii</i>, and <i>Th. Wilsoni</i>. Their smaller size,
and the more rapid motions of their wings, rendered them quite conspicuous,
and suggested the idea of their being a new species, although
a closer inspection shewed them to belong to the present. In their
general manners, while feeding, floating on the water, or rambling
round the boat in which I went in pursuit of them, they did not differ
materially from the other species. Their flight, however, was more
hurried and irregular, and none of them uttered any note or cry, even
when wounded and captured. I have been assured that this bird breeds
on the sandy beaches of Sable Island on the coast of Nova Scotia;
but not having had an opportunity of visiting it, or any other breeding
place, I here present you with Mr <span class="smcap">Hewitson</span>’s observations on
this subject.
</p>

<p>
“In an excursion,” says this amiable and enterprising naturalist,
“through the Shetland Islands during the present summer, in search of
rarities for this work (the British Oology), I had the very great satisfaction
of seeing and taking many of these most interesting birds alive;
they breed in great numbers on several of the islands, principally upon
Foula, the north of Hunst, and upon Papa, and Oxna, two small islands
in the Bay of Scalloway; the last of these I visited on the 31st of May
in hopes of procuring their eggs (it being the season in which most of
the sea-birds begin to lay); but in this I was disappointed; the fishermen
who knew them well by the name of Swallows, assured me that
my search would be quite useless, that they had not yet “come up
from sea,” and so it proved. Sixteen days after this (June 16th and
three following days) I was at Foula, but was alike unsuccessful, the
birds had arrived at their breeding places, but had not yet begun laying
their eggs; numbers of them were sitting in their holes, and were
easily caught; one man brought me about a dozen tied up in an old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
stocking, two of which I kept alive in my room for nearly three days,
and derived very great pleasure from their company; during the day
they were mostly inactive, and after pacing about the floor for a short
time, poking their head into every hole, they hid themselves between
the feet of the table and the wall; I could not prevail upon them to
eat any thing, though I tried to tempt them with fish and oil; their
manner of walking is very light and pleasing, and differing from that
of every other bird which I have seen; they carry their body so far
forward and so nearly horizontal, as to give them the appearance of
being out of equilibrium. In the evening, toward sun-set, they left
their hiding places, and for hours afterwards, never ceased in their endeavours
to regain their liberty; flying round and round the room, or
fluttering against the windows; when flying, their length of wing,
and white above the tail, gives them a good deal the appearance of our
House-Martin. I went to bed and watched them in their noiseless
flight long ere I fell asleep, but in the morning they had disappeared;
one had fortunately made its escape through a broken pane in the window
which a towel should have occupied, the other had fallen into a
basin, full of the yolks of eggs which I had been blowing, and was
drowned. I regretted much the fate of a being so interesting, by its
very remarkable, wandering, solitary, and harmless life. Before leaving
Shetland I again visited the island of Oxna, and though so late as the
30th of June, they were only just beginning to lay their eggs. In
Foula they breed in the holes in the cliff, at a great height above the
sea; but here under stones which form the beach, at a depth of three
or four feet, or more, according to that of the stones; as they go down
to the earth, beneath them, on which to lay their eggs. In walking
over the surface, I could hear them, very distinctly, singing in a sort
of warbling chatter, a good deal like swallows when fluttering above
our chimneys, but harsher; and in this way, by listening attentively,
was guided to their retreat, and, after throwing out stones as large as
I could lift on all sides of me, seldom failed in capturing two or three
seated on their nests, either under the lowest stone or between two of
them. The nests, though of much the same materials as the ground
on which they were placed, seem to have been made with care; they
were of small bits of stalks of plants, and pieces of hard dry earth.
Like the rest of the genus, the Stormy Petrel lays invariably one egg
only. During the day-time they remain within their holes; and though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
the fishermen are constantly passing over their heads (the beach under
which they breed being appropriated for the drying of fish), they are
then seldom heard, but toward night become extremely querulous; and
when most other birds are gone to rest, issue forth in great numbers,
spreading themselves far over the surface of the sea. The fishermen
then meet them very numerously; and though they have not previously
seen one, are sure to be surrounded by them upon throwing
pieces of fish overboard.”
</p>

<p>
The egg measures one inch and an eighth in length, six and a half
eighths in breadth, is nearly equally rounded at both ends, rather thick-shelled,
and pure white, but generally with numerous minute dots of
dull red at the larger end, sometimes forming a circular band.

Fig. 3. represents:—the proventricular sac thrust forward, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>,

<p>
The proventricular glands are very numerous, but not so closely
placed as is usual, although scattered over a much larger extent, from
<i>e</i> to <i>g</i> in Fig. 2. Between the termination of the glands and the stomach
there is a portion destitute of glandules. The stomach or gizzard
has its muscular coat thick, its tendons moderate, its inner surface
covered with a rather thick but not very hard epithelium, which
is more prolonged on two opposite sides, although in the fundus it is
complete.
</p>

<p>
This curious digestive apparatus agrees very nearly with that described
and figured by Sir <span class="smcap">Everard Home</span> as that of <i>Alca Alle</i>. The
stomach, it is seen, is excessively large in proportion to the size of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
bird; but why it should be so, and moreover be curved in this manner,
is not very obvious. Conjectures are easily made, and might run in
this form. This little bird, which wanders over the face of the ocean,
subsisting upon garbage, oily and fatty substances, small fishes, and
even sea-weeds, requires a large stomach for the reception of its heterogeneous
fare, which not being always very nutritious or easily digestible,
must be very plentifully intermixed with the gastric juices, and
detained a considerable time; which conditions are accordingly provided
for by the very great number and extensive dispersion of the proventricular
glandules, and the curve of the organ. Should any hard substances,
as crustacea, be introduced, they are pounded by the gizzard;
but as the bird is little addicted to feeding on such substances, that
organ is reduced to a very small size.
</p>

<p>
The aperture of the glottis is <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfth long. The trachea is 1

GREAT AUK.

<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXLI. Adult.</span>
</p>


<p>
The only authentic account of the occurrence of this bird on our
coast that I possess, was obtained from Mr <span class="smcap">Henry Havell</span>, brother
of my Engraver, who, when on his passage from New York to England,
hooked a Great Auk on the banks of Newfoundland, in extremely
boisterous weather. On being hauled on board, it was left at liberty
on the deck. It walked very awkwardly, often tumbling over, bit
every one within reach of its powerful bill, and refused food of all kinds.
After continuing several days on board, it was restored to its proper
element.
</p>

<p>
When I was in Labrador, many of the fishermen assured me that
the “Penguin,” as they name this bird, breeds on a low rocky island
to the south-east of Newfoundland, where they destroy great numbers
of the young for bait; but as this intelligence came to me when the
season was too far advanced, I had no opportunity of ascertaining its
accuracy. In Newfoundland, however, I received similar information
from several individuals. An old gunner residing on Chelsea Beach,
near Boston, told me that he well remembered the time when the Penguins
were plentiful about Nahant and some other islands in the Bay.
</p>

<p>
The egg is very large, measuring five inches in length, and three
in its greatest breadth. In form it resembles that of the Common
Guillemot; the shell is thick and rather rough to the touch; its colour
yellowish-white, with long irregular lines and blotches of brownish-black,
more numerous at the larger end.

<h2>
GOLDEN-EYE DUCK.
</h2>

<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXLII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
You have now before you another of our Ducks, which at least
equals any of the rest in the extent of its migrations. Braving the blasts
of the north, it visits the highest latitudes in spring, and returns at the
approach of winter, spreading over the whole country, as if it seemed
not to care in what region it spends its time, provided it find abundance
of water. Now propelling itself gaily, it may be seen searching the
pebbly or rocky bottom of the Ohio, or diving deep in the broad bays
of Massachusetts or the Chesapeake. Presently it emerges with a
cray-fish or a mussel held firmly in its bill. It shakes its head, and
over its flattened back roll the large pearly drops of water, unable to
penetrate the surface of its compact and oily plumage. The food is
swallowed, and the bird, having already glanced around, suddenly
plunges headlong. Happy being! Equally fitted for travelling through
the air and the water, and not altogether denied the pleasure of walking
on the shore; endowed with a cunning, too, which preserves you from
many at least of the attempts of man to destroy you; and instinctively
sagacious enough to place your eggs deep in the hollow of a tree,
where they are secure from the nocturnal prowler, and, amid the down
of your snowy breast, are fostered until the expected young come forth.
Then with your own bill you carry your brood to the lake, where under
your tender care they grow apace. The winged marauders, rapid
as their flight may be, cannot injure you there; for while your young
ones sink into the deep waters, you arise on whistling wings, and,
swifter than Jer Falcon, speed away.
</p>

<p>
In South Carolina the Golden-eye is abundant during winter, when
it at times frequents the reserves of the rice-planters. I have also met
with it on the water-courses of the Floridas at that season. From
these countries westward and northward, it may be found in all parts
of the Union where the waters are not frozen. It is seldom seen on
small ponds entirely surrounded by trees, but prefers open places, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
on the Ohio is generally found in the more rapid parts, on the eddies
of which it dives for food.
</p>

<p>
This species exhibits a degree of cunning which surpasses that of
many other Ducks, and yet at times it appears quite careless. When
I have been walking, without any object in view, along the banks of
the Ohio, between Shippingport and Louisville, I have often seen the
Golden-eyes, fishing almost beneath me, when, although I had a gun,
they would suffer me to approach within an hundred paces. But at
other times, if I crawled or hid myself in any way while advancing towards
them, with a wish to fire at them, they would, as if perfectly
aware of my intentions, keep at a distance of fully two hundred yards.
On the former occasion they would follow their avocations quite unconcernedly:
while on the latter, one of the flock would remain above
as if to give intimation of the least appearance of danger. If, in the
first instance, I fired my gun at them, they would all dive with the celerity
of lightning, but on emerging, would shake their wings as if in
defiance. But if far away on the stream, when I fired at them, instead
of diving, they would all at once stretch their necks, bend their bodies
over the water, and paddle off with their broad webbed feet, until the
air would resound with the smart whistling of their wings, and away
they would speed, quite out of sight, up the river. In this part of the
country, they are generally known by the name of “Whistlers.”
</p>

<p>
I have observed that birds of this species rarely go to the shores to
rest until late in the evening, and even then they retire to secluded
rocks, slightly elevated above the surface, or to the margins of sand-bars,
well protected by surrounding waters. In either case, it is extremely
difficult for a man to get near them; but it is different with the sly
Racoon, which I have on several occasions surprised in the dawn, feeding
on one which it had caught under night. Yet, on some of the
bays of our sea-coasts, the Whistlers are easily enticed to alight by the
coarsest representations of their figures in wooden floats, and are shot
while they pass and repass over the place to assure themselves that
what they see is actually a bird of their own kind. This mode is successfully
followed in the Bay and Harbour of Boston in Massachusetts,
as well as farther to the eastward.
</p>

<p>
The Golden-eye is rarely if ever seen in the company of any other
species than those which are, like itself, expert divers; such, for example,
as the Mergansers, or the Buffel-headed Duck: and it is very rare to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
see all the individuals of a flock immersed at once. Sometimes, when
suddenly surprised, they immediately dive, and do not rise again until
quite out of gun-shot. When wounded, it is next to impossible to
catch them; for their power of remaining under water is most surprising,
and the sooner one gives up the chase the better.
</p>

<p>
The Golden-eye Ducks manifest a propensity to adhere to a place
which they find productive, and that to a most extraordinary degree.
One day, while approaching the shallow fording-place of Canoe Creek,
near Henderson, in Kentucky, I observed five Whistlers fishing and
swimming about. They allowed me to advance to within a few yards
of the shore, when, swimming close together, and shaking their necks,
they emitted their rough croaking notes. Not being desirous of shooting
them, I slapped my hands smartly together, when in an instant
they all went down, but suddenly rose again, and running as it were
over the water for about ten yards, took flight, passed and repassed
several times over the ford, and alighted on the large branches of a
sycamore that hung over the creek, at no greater distance from where
I stood than about twenty yards. This was the first time in my life
that I had seen Golden-eyes alight on a tree. I waded to the opposite
side, and gazed upon them with amazement for several minutes. When
on the eve of pursuing my course, one of them, gliding downwards with
nearly closed wings, launched upon the water, and at once dived. The
other four followed one after another, somewhat in the manner of
Pigeons or Starlings, as if to ascertain whether some danger might not
still exist. I left them at their avocations, and soon after met a family
of country people going to Henderson, one of whom asked me respecting
the depth of the ford, to which I replied that the water was low,
and added that they should be careful lest some ducks that I had left
there might frighten the horses on which the women were. The good
folks, with whom I was acquainted, laughed, and we parted.
</p>

<p>
About four o’clock, as I was returning, with a fine Turkey-cock
slung to my back, I met the same party, who told me that, “sure
enough,” the ducks were at the ford, and I was likely to have “a good
crack at them.” There they were when I went up, and I forced them
to fly off; but as I was proceeding, and not more than fifty yards beyond
the creek, I heard their splashings as they again alighted. In the
course of a fortnight I visited the place several times, but never missed
finding these five ducks there. This led me to inquire as to the cause,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
and, having undressed, I waded out barefooted, and examined the bottom,
which I found to be composed of rather hard blue clay, full of
holes bored by cray-fish. But to make myself quite sure that these
creatures formed the attraction to the Ducks, I watched an opportunity,
and shot two of the latter, the examination of which satisfied me
on the subject.
</p>

<p>
I had long before this been convinced, that an abundant supply of
food afforded a powerful attraction to migrating birds, and on this subject
you may remember my remarks in the articles of the Wild Turkey
and Passenger Pigeon, in the first volume of this work; but I had not
then, nor have I since, seen so strong an instance of pertinacity in attachment
to a particular spot.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is powerful, extremely rapid, and wonderfully
protracted. It passes along with a speed equal to that of any of
the Duck tribe, and I believe can easily traverse the space of ninety
miles in an hour. The whistling of its wings may be distinctly heard
when it is more than half a mile distant. This statement may be found
to be in contradiction to those of probably every previous writer, for it
has been a general opinion, that the greater the extent of wing the
more rapid is the flight, which is anything but correct. On flying from
the water, they proceed for a considerable distance very low, not rising
to any height until they have advanced several hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
The only nest of the Golden-eye which I have examined, I discovered,
on the 15th of June, on the margin of a small creek about eight
miles from Green Bay. The female left it, probably to go in search
of food, whilst I was sitting under the tree in which it was, thinking
more of my peculiar situation than of birds of any kind, for I was almost
destitute of ammunition, and bent on returning to my family,
then in Louisiana. How exciting are such moments to the ardent observer
of Nature! In an instant, hunger, fatigue, even the thoughts
of my beloved wife and children, vanished; and in a few minutes I was
safely lodged on the tree, and thrusting my arm into the cavity of a large
broken branch. Nine beautiful, greenish, smooth eggs, almost equally
rounded at both ends, were at my disposal. They were laid on some
dry grass of the kind that grew on the edges of the creek, and were
deeply imbedded in the down of the bird. Not being then aware of
the necessity of measuring or keeping eggs, I roasted them on some
embers, and finding them truly delicious, soon satisfied my hunger.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
While I was eating them, the bird returned, but no male was to be
seen. Whether many of these birds breed within the limits of the
Union I cannot tell. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> says they are abundant in the
Fur Countries, and Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> states, that they are plentiful on the
Rocky Mountains and along the north-west coast of America.
</p>

<p>
Of the changes which the young males undergo, nothing is known
beyond the fact, that the young of both sexes resemble the adult female,
until the approach of the first spring, when their general migration
northward removes them from our observation.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of spring, I have observed this species swell the
throat and the feathers of the head, and emit their rough croaking
notes very frequently. The males at this period become very pugnacious,
though, after all, they remove northward together, preceding the
females for at least a fortnight. They usually spend the autumn and
the earlier parts of winter separate from the females. These birds
have, like the Goosanders, a habit of shaking their heads violently
on emerging from the water  Their flesh is fishy, and in my opinion
unfit for being eaten, unless in cases of excessive hunger. The food
of this species, while on fresh water, consists of fish of various kinds,
mollusca, young frogs, tadpoles, crayfish, and, I believe, some kinds
of grass. When on salt water, they feed principally on bivalves and
fishes of different species.

An adult male examined. The tongue is 2 inches long, fleshy, papillate
at the base, with two series of lateral filaments, a deep median
groove, and a thin semicircular tip, as in many other ducks. The œsophagus
is 10 inches long, of moderate diameter, dilated towards the
lower part of the neck to <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span> inch; its walls very thick; the proventriculus
with numerous oblong glandules. The stomach is a large and
powerful gizzard, of a roundish form, 2 inches long, and of equal diameter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
its lateral muscles very large, and upwards of half an inch thick;
its epithelium rugous. The intestine is 6 feet 1 inch long, its diameter
varying from 5 twelfths to 4 twelfths; the rectum 4 inches long; the
cœca <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches in length, their greatest diameter <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths. The contents
of the stomach a soft mass of a reddish colour, in which are distinguished
small mussels and remains of fishes, with some vegetable
fibres.
</p>

<p>
The trachea is 9 inches long, for 4 inches narrow, its diameter
being about <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths, and its rings, which are 60 in number, cartilaginous;
it then forms an ovato-oblong expansion, which, when drawn
out, is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, and 1 inch in breadth, and is formed of ossified
and flattened rings, narrower behind, placed obliquely, and about 30 in
number; it then contracts to a diameter of 5 twelfths, and has 16 free
rings, but below this the rings, 25 in number, become united or blended,
and gradually expand into a vast irregular cavity, having a broad
bony frame in front, membranous behind, and separating to the distance
of 1 inch, the bronchi, which are large, the right one much
larger and longer than the left, and composed of 20 rings, all of which
are almost complete and cartilaginous, excepting the two upper. The
rings of the left bronchus, also about 20, are more incomplete.
</p>

<p>
Now for conjectures. These enormous dilatations are intended
for strengthening the voice. But the voice is not strong in this duck.
Well, then, they are receptacles of air, to enable the bird to keep
longer under water. But the bird does not keep longer under water
than many other ducks, and besides, the female, which has no such dilatations,
dives as well as the male.
</p>

<p>
One use at least is this. A comparison of the windpipe of an
American Golden-eye, with those of two Scotch ones, shews that the
so-called <i>Clangula Americana</i>, is in this respect precisely similar to the
<i>Clangula chrysophthalma</i>. Their digestive organs are also the same;
and American skins compared with European skins, exhibit no differences
of the slightest importance. Some individuals, especially males,
have much larger bills than others, but this happens in the birds of
both countries, and the Golden-eye is not singular in this respect.
<i>Clangula Americana</i>, therefore, requires a better elucidation than the
appendage of a “Nob,” before it can be admitted as a species.

<h2>
RUDDY DUCK.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula rubida</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXLIII. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
Look at this plate, Reader, and tell me whether you ever saw a
greater difference between young and old, or between male and female,
than is apparent here. You see a fine old male in the livery of the
breeding season, put on as it were expressly for the purpose of pleasing
the female for a while. The female has never been figured before;
nor, I believe, has any representation been given of the young in the
autumnal plumage. Besides these, you have here the young male at
the approach of spring.
</p>

<p>
The Ruddy Duck is by no means a rare species in the United States;
indeed I consider it quite abundant, especially during the winter months,
in the Peninsula of Florida, where I have shot upwards of forty in one
morning. In our Eastern Districts they make their appearance early
in September, and are then plentiful from Eastport to Boston, in
the markets of which, as well as of New York, I have seen them.
On the Ohio and Mississippi they arrive about the same period; and I
have no doubt that they will be found breeding in all our Western
Territories, as soon as attention is paid to such matters as the searching
for nests with the view of promoting science, or of domesticating
birds which might prove advantageous to the husbandman.
</p>

<p>
My friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> informs me that this species is becoming
more abundant every winter in South Carolina. In the month of February
he has seen a space of the extent of an acre covered with it. Yet
he has never found one in full summer plumage in that country. It is
equally fond of salt or brackish and of fresh waters; and thus we find
it at times on our sea-coast, bays, and mouths of rivers, as well as on
lakes and even small ponds in the interior, or on our salt marshes, provided
they are not surrounded by trees, as it cannot rise high in the
air unless in an open space of considerable extent. At the time of
their arrival, they are seen in small flocks, more than from seven to ten
being seldom found together, until they reach the Southern States,
where they congregate in great flocks. When they leave their northern
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
breeding-grounds, some proceed along the coast, but a greater number
along our numerous rivers.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Ruddy Duck is rapid, with a whirring sound, occasioned
by the concave form of the wings and their somewhat broad
ends, the whistling sound produced by other species having more
pointed and stiffer quills, not being heard in this, or only in a very
slight degree. They rise from the water, with considerable difficulty,
being obliged to assist themselves with their broad webbed feet, and to
run as it were on the surface for several yards, always against the
breeze, when it blows smartly. The strength of the muscles of their
feet enables them to spring from the ground at once. When they are
fairly on wing, they fly in the same manner as most of our travelling
ducks, sustain themselves with ease, and are apt to remove to great distances.
They alight on the water more heavily than most others that are
not equally flattened and short in the body; but they move on that element
with ease and grace, swimming deeply immersed, and procuring
their food altogether by diving, at which they are extremely expert. They
are generally disposed to keep under the lee of shores on all occasions.
When swimming without suspicion of danger, they carry the tail elevated
almost perpendicularly, and float lightly on the water; but as
soon as they are alarmed, they immediately sink deeper, in the manner
of the Anhinga, Grebes, and Cormorants, sometimes going out of sight
without leaving a ripple on the water. On small ponds they often dive
and conceal themselves among the grass along the shore, rather than
attempt to escape by flying, to accomplish which with certainty they
would require a large open space. I saw this very often when on
the plantation of General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span> in East Florida. If wounded,
they dived and hid in the grass; but, as the ponds there were shallow,
and had the bottom rather firm, I often waded out and pursued them.
Then it was that I saw the curious manner in which they used their
tail when swimming, employing it now as a rudder, and again with a
vertical motion; the wings being also slightly opened, and brought into
action as well as the feet. They are by no means shy, for I have often
waded toward them with my gun until very near them, when I cared not
about shooting them, but was on the look-out for a new Rail or Gallinule,
along the margin of the ponds. They are often seen in company
with Teals, Scaup Ducks, Gadwalls, Shovellers, and Mallards, with all
of which they seem to agree.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My opinion that the males of this species lose the brightness of
their spring dress before they return to us in autumn, is founded on the
occurrence of multitudes of males at that season destitute of the garb
in question, and my examination of many for the purpose of determining
their sex and ascertaining that they were old birds. In February
1832, I saw immense flocks of Ruddy Ducks about an hundred miles
up the St John’s in Florida. They would start from the water, as our
schooner advanced under sail, patting it with their feet, so as to make
a curious and rather loud noise, somewhat resembling the fall of hail-stones
on the shingles. Their notes are uttered in a rather low tone
and very closely resemble those of the female Mallard. They afford
good eating when fat and young, and especially when they have been
feeding for some weeks on fresh waters, where their food generally consists
of the roots and blades of such grasses as spring from the bottom
of rivers and ponds, as well as of the seeds of many gramineæ. When
on salt marshes, they eat small univalve shells, fiddlers, and young crabs,
and on the sea-coast, they devour fry of various sorts. Along with
their food, they swallow great quantities of sand or gravel.
</p>

<p>
At St Augustine, in Florida, I shot a young bird of this species
immediately under the walls of the fort. Although wounded severely
and with one of its legs broken close to the body, it dived at once.
My Newfoundland dog leaped into the water, and on reaching the spot
where the bird had disappeared, dived also, and in a few moments came
up with the poor thing in his mouth. When the dog approached
I observed that the duck had seized his nose with its bill; and when I
laid hold of it, it tried to bite me also. I have found this species hard
to kill, and when wounded very tenacious of life, swimming and diving
at times to the last gasp.
</p>

<p>
In the Fauna Boreali-Americana, the tail of the Ruddy Duck is
said to be composed of sixteen feathers, and in <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s Manual of
twenty; but the number is eighteen.

<p>
I have often spoken of the great differences as to size and colour
that are observed in birds of the same species, and which have frequently
given rise to mistakes, insomuch that the male, the female,
and the young, have been considered as so many distinct species. The
Long-legged Sandpiper has been treated in this manner, and has latterly
reappeared under the name of <i>Tringa Douglassii</i>, in the Fauna
Boreali-Americana of my friends <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> and <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>. <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>
was, in truth, the first who described this bird; and although
some differences might be found between his specimen and the <i>one</i> described
in the work just mentioned, they are trifling compared with
those which I have observed between seven or eight individuals all
procured from the same flock at a single shot. It is strange that
neither <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span> nor <span class="smcap">Swainson</span> have mentioned the sex of their

On the morning of the 4th of April 1837, while seated among the
drift wood that had accumulated on the southern shore of the island of
Barataria, forty miles from the south-west pass of the Mississippi, and
occupied in observing some Pelicans, I saw a flock of about thirty
Long-legged Sandpipers alight within ten steps of me, near the water.
They immediately scattered, following the margin of the retiring
and advancing waves, in search of food, which I could see them
procure by probing the wet sand in the manner of Curlews, that is, to
the full length of their bill, holding it for a short time in the sand, as
if engaged in sucking up what they found. In this way they continued
feeding on an extended line of shore of about thirty yards, and it was
pleasing to see the alacrity with which they simultaneously advanced
and retreated, according to the motions of the water. In about three
quarters of an hour, during all which time I had watched them with
attention, they removed a few yards beyond the highest wash of the
waves, huddled close together, and began to plume and cleanse themselves.
All of a sudden they ceased their occupation, stood still, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' href='#Page_333'>333</a></span>
several of them emitted a sharp <i>tweet-tweet</i>, somewhat resembling the
notes of <i>Totanus solitarius</i>; immediately after which seven birds of
the same species passed close to me, and alighted near those which I
had already watched. They at once began to feed, and as I thought
that the first flock might join them, and that I might lose the opportunity
of procuring specimens, in sufficient number, I fired and killed
eleven. The rest flew off, and were joined by the second group, the
whole flying to windward in a compact body, and emitting every now
and then their sharp <i>tweet</i>, <i>tweet</i>, until out of sight and hearing.
</p>

<p>
My son <span class="smcap">John</span> obtained several of these birds on the same island
while they were feeding on the margins of a fresh-water pond; and we
saw them on almost every island and bay on our way to the Texas,
where we also procured some on Galveston Island.
</p>

<p>
The flight of these Sandpipers is rapid and regular. They move compactly,
and often when about to alight, or after being disturbed, incline
their bodies to either side, shewing alternately the upper and lower
parts. On foot they move more like Curlews than Tringas, they being
as it were more sedate in their deportment. At times, on the approach
of a person, they squat on the ground, very much in the manner
of the Esquimaux Curlew, <i>Numenius borealis</i>; and their flesh is as
delicate as that of the species just named. In the stomach of several
individuals I found small worms, minute shell-fish, and vegetable substances,
among which were the hard seeds of plants unknown to me. I
suspect that in summer and autumn they feed on small fruits and
berries, though of this I have no proof.
</p>

<p>
Among those which we procured, I found the differences in the
colour of the plumage quite as great as in <i>Scolopax noveboracensis</i>, some
of the younger birds being yet in their winter dress, while the older had
already assumed a reddish colour on the cheeks, the top of the head, and
the breast. The females were all larger than the males, and differed from
each other not only in the markings of the plumage, but also in the
length of the bill, to the extent of a quarter of an inch, and of the legs,
to a still greater extent. Whether or not this species assumes a uniform
reddish tint in the breeding season, such as is observed in the Pigmy
Curlew, <i>Tringa subarquata</i>, I am unable to say, although I am much
inclined to think that it does.
</p>

<p>
Their passage through the United States is very rapid, both in

spring and autumn, Some few spend the winter in Lower Louisiana,
but nearly all proceed southward beyond the Texas.

AMERICAN WIDGEON.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Anas Americana</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXLV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
This lively and very handsome Duck is abundant during winter at
New Orleans, where it is much esteemed on account of the juiciness of
its flesh, and is best known by the name of <i>Zinzin</i>. In the Western
Country, and in most parts of the Eastern and Middle States, it is
called the <i>Bald Pate</i>. Early in September it enters the United States
by their northern extremities, as well as from the Texas; and in both
these regions it is now well known to breed in nearly equal numbers.
Those which retreat south-westward remain along the coast and in the
interior of the Floridas, as well as all that portion of the Gulf of
Mexico extending to the mouths of the Mississippi, where they remain
until the latter part of April, sometimes even until the middle of May,
as they have but a comparatively short journey to perform in order to
arrive in Mexico in time to breed. On the coast of the Atlantic they
keep in the marshes in company with various species of the same family,
being in a manner indifferent as to their associates. During early
spring, in Louisiana, they are often seen alighted on extensive plains
that have very little water on them.
</p>

<p>
While advancing along the shores of the Bay of Mexico, in April
1837, I and my party observed this species in considerable numbers;
and during the whole of our stay in the Texas, we daily saw and very
frequently procured Widgeons. There they were found in ponds of
brackish water, as well as in the fresh-water streams. Before we left
that country they were all paired, and I was informed by the Honourable
<span class="smcap">M. Fisher</span>, Secretary to the Texian Navy, that a good number of
them breed in the maritime districts, along with several other Ducks,
and that he annually received many of the young birds. Their manners
at this time fully proved the correctness of the statements of all
those who spoke to me on this subject. Indeed my opinion is that
some of these birds also propagate in certain portions of the most southern
districts of the Floridas, and in the Island of Cuba, as I have seen
Widgeons in the peninsula in single pairs, in the beginning of May.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Their retrograde movements in spring, like those of other species,
depend much upon the temperature or the advance of the season; and
those which proceed northward set out on their journey much earlier
than those which move in the opposite direction, the former departing
from the middle of March to the 20th of April. Their first appearance
on the waters of the Ohio takes place late in September or early in
October, when they at once throw themselves into the ponds of the interior,
and there remain until the waters are closed by ice, scarcely any
betaking themselves to the rivers, unless to repose on the sand-bars.
They are there, however, less abundant than nearer the sea-coast, and
usually associate with Pintails and Teals, but rarely with Mallards or
Dusky Ducks. Whilst in those retired ponds of the forest, from one
to another of which they roam in quest of food, they are less noisy
than most other species, even than the Pintails, and in this respect
resemble the Blue-winged Teals, whose notes are feeble and delicate.
Those of the Widgeon are a soft whistle somewhat similar to the word
<i>Sweet</i>, enunciated as if produced by a flute or a hautboy, and in my
judgment not at all like the <i>hew hew</i> spoken off by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>. They are
less shy in those retired places than most species, or are to appearance
less aware of the danger of allowing the sportsman to approach them.
</p>

<p>
In feeding they immerse their neck and the anterior part of the
body, generally swimming closer together than other Ducks, in consequence
of which habits they are easily neared and often shot in great
numbers at a single discharge. During their stay in those districts
they feed on the roots and seeds of grasses, water-insects, beech-nuts,
small fry, and leeches, and are not so delicate as an article of food
as those procured in the rice-fields of South Carolina, or in the plantations
of Louisiana and Florida. On their return in spring (for in
mild winters they remain all the season in Kentucky), they generally
continue until the end of April, and usually pair before they depart;
which induces me to believe that numbers of them breed within the
northern limits of the United States, although I have not heard of any
having actually been seen doing so.
</p>

<p>
On the lakes near New Orleans, as well as on the Chesapeake, they
are not unfrequently found in company with the Canvass-back Ducks.
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> mentions their being partially supplied with food by the industry
of the latter; but they manage very well in most parts without
such assistance. When in full security, the Bald-pates feed at all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
hours of the day; but in thickly inhabited parts of the country, they
usually seek for food at night or early in the morning.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is rather swift, well sustained, and accompanied
by the whistling sound of the wings usual in birds of this family.
They move in flocks of moderate size, and without much care as to the
disposition of their ranks, being sometimes extended into a front line,
sometimes in single file, frequently mingled confusedly, and flying at a
moderate height, whether over the land or over the water. When
they are first started, they fly almost perpendicularly, in a hurried and
rather irregular manner. They walk prettily and with ease. After
heavy falls of rain in our Southern States, they often alight in the corn
fields, in company with other Ducks, where the ploughed earth, being
quite moist and soft, yields them an abundant supply of worms and insects,
as well as grains of corn, pease, and other equally nutritious
substances.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that this species breeds in the woody
districts of the Fur Countries, up to their most northern limits, in latitude
80°; and Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> states that it is abundant on the Columbia
River; but he has not furnished me with any account of its
breeding, and I have not had an opportunity of observing it during the
season of propagation, as I left the Texas without having found a nest
or young.

A very great diversity of colouring exists in this species, which,
however, is not yet properly understood. Although males are often
found as described above, and as represented in the plate, others have
a very different appearance. Thus, an individual shot at the mouth
of the Mississippi, in the beginning of April 1837, has the head and
neck brownish-orange, the feathers all minutely tipped with dark green,
the lower fore neck lilac; all the upper parts finely undulated with
white and dusky, as are the sides; the wing-coverts light brownish-grey; 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
the other parts as described above, but the upper tail-coverts
black at the end. In some individuals the top of the head is reddish-white,
in others light red, in others pure white; in some, most of the
smaller wing-coverts are white, in others grey or brownish-grey; in
some the throat is whitish, in others black. These differences, no
doubt, depend upon age and season.
</p>

<p>
The American Widgeon has been considered distinct from the
European; not on account of any difference in size or form, or texture
of plumage, but because it has in certain stages a green band on the
side of the head, which the European bird is said not to have. The
mirror is the same in both; the wing-coverts are white or grey in both;
the crown is white, or cream-coloured, or orange-brown, in both; but
in the European the head and neck are described as reddish-chestnut,
and in the American as yellowish-white. Now, in fact, American birds
sometimes have the head and neck red, and European Birds sometimes
have the green streak on the side of the head. In short, on comparing
specimens from America, with others from India and Norway, I cannot
perceive any essential difference. At the same time, not having
traced our Widgeon through all its gradations, and being equally unacquainted
with all those of the European and Asiatic Widgeon, I cannot
<i>positively</i> affirm that <i>Anas Americana</i> is identical with <i>Anas Penelope</i>.

The roof of the mouth is deeply concave, with a median prominent
line, and numerous irregular small tubercles on the sides, with several
larger ones at the fore part. Two large branches of the supra-maxillary
nerve run in this ridge, as in other ducks. The tongue is 1 inch 5 twelfths
long, with numerous straight, pointed papillæ at the base, a median
longitudinal groove, and a thin broadly rounded point. The œsophagus,

œsophagus are contained slender leaves of grasses; in the gizzard some
of these leaves and other vegetable matters, small seeds, and a great
quantity of sand. The cuticular lining or epithelium is dense, slightly
rugous, much thickened on the spaces opposite the middle of the lateral

BLACK-THROATED DIVER.

<span class="smcap"><i>Colymbus Arcticus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXLVI. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
One of the most remarkable circumstances relative to this beautiful
bird, which is intermediate between the Red-throated Diver and
the Loon, is the extraordinary extent to which the wanderings of the
young are carried in autumn and winter. It breeds in the remote regions
of the north, from which many of the old birds, it would seem,
do not remove far, while the young, as soon as they are able to travel,
take to wing and disperse, spreading not only over the greater part of
the United States, but beyond their south-western limits. In the
Texas I saw individuals of this species as late as the middle of April
1837; and I find it enumerated in a list of the birds observed by my
young friend Dr <span class="smcap">J. K. Townsend</span> on the Columbia River, where he
also met with <i>Columbus glacialis</i>. Its ramblings over a considerable
portion of northern and eastern Europe have equally been noted, and
it has been found breeding in the extreme north of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
For many years I knew the young of this bird only by the name
“Imber Diver,” applied by <span class="smcap">Bewick</span> to that of another species, and
now have pleasure in looking upon a drawing of mine, made about
thirty years ago, with that appellation attached to it. Very few old
birds in full plumage have been procured within the limits of the United
States, and none in as far as I know, farther south than the Capes of
Delaware.
</p>

<p>
No sooner has the foliage of the trees that border our western waters
begun to drop and float on the gentle current of the fair Ohio, than
the Black-throated Diver makes its appearance there, moving slowly
with the stream. The Mississippi, Missouri, and their tributaries, are
at the same period supplied with these birds. Along our eastern and
southern shores they are seen from the end of autumn until spring.
</p>

<p>
Whilst in Labrador, I saw a few pairs courting on wing, much in
the manner of the Red-throated Diver; but all our exertions failed to
procure any of the nests, which I therefore think must have been placed
farther inland than those of the Loon or Red-throated Diver. I observed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
however, that in their general habits they greatly resemble those
species, for on alighting on the water, they at once immerse their bills,
as if for the purpose of ascertaining whether it yields a supply of suitable
food, and afterwards raise themselves and beat their wings.
</p>

<p>
This species has almost as powerful a flight as the Great Northern
Diver or Loon, and I think shoots through the air with even greater
velocity. When flying it moves its wings rapidly and continuously,
and has the neck and feet stretched out to their full length. I well recollect
that while I was standing near the shore of a large inlet in
South Carolina, one of these birds, being shot while passing over my
head at full speed, did not, on account of the impetus, reach the ground
until upwards of twenty yards beyond me. They are equally expert
at diving, and fully as much so in eluding the pursuit of their enemies
when wounded. I saw my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Harris</span> bring down one from on
wing, on which <span class="smcap">Napoleon Coste</span>, and <span class="smcap">William Taylor</span>, Captains of
the Revenue Cutter and Tender of which we had the use, paddled in
pursuit of it in a light canoe; but, although they advanced with all
the address of Indians, they proved unsuccessful, for after following it
both in the Bay of Cayo Island, and in the Bay of Mexico, for nearly
an hour, they were obliged to return without it, having found it apparently
not in the least fatigued, although it had dived sufficiently often
to travel above two miles, shifting its course at each immersion. It is
curious to observe how carefully these birds avoid the danger of sudden
storms or heavy gales. On such occasions, I have seen Divers at
once seek the lee of rocks, islands, or artificial embankments, where
they could not only remain in security, but also procure their accustomed
food. At other times, when striving against the tempest, they
dive headlong from on wing, and are sure to reappear in the smooth
parts which sailors term the trough.
</p>

<p>
I once caught one of these birds on the Ohio, it having been incapacitated
from diving by having swallowed a large mussel, which stuck
in its throat. It was kept for several days, but refused food of every
kind, exhibited much bad humour, struck with its bill, and died of inanition.
The food of this species consists of fish, aquatic reptiles, testaceous
mollusca, and all sorts of small crustaceous animals. Its flesh
resembles that of the Loon, and is equally unfit to be eaten.
</p>

<p>
The eggs, which are sometimes two, more frequently three, average
three inches in length, by two in their greatest breadth, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
is about a third of the whole length distant from the extremity. Their
form is that of the Red-throated Diver, which however they exceed
in size. The shell is rather thick, the surface roughish, the ground
colour chocolate tinged with olive, sparingly spotted at the larger end
with very dark umber and black, and sprinkled all over with very small
dots of the same colour.

I have represented an adult male, a female, and a young bird.

<p>
The Smew is a bird of extremely rare occurrence in the United
States, insomuch that it must be considered merely as a transient or
accidental visitor. Indeed I have felt strong misgivings on reading
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s article on this species, and cannot but think that he is mistaken
when he states that it “is much more common on the coast of
New England than farther south,” and again “In the ponds of New
England, and some of the lakes in the State of New York, where the
Smew is frequently observed—.” Now, although I have made diligent
inquiry, not only in New England, but in every part of our country
where I thought it likely that the Smew might occur, I have not
met with any person well acquainted with birds of this family, who has
seen it. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, in short, was in all probability misinformed, and it
is my opinion that his figure was made from a stuffed European specimen
which was then in Peale’s Museum in Philadelphia, and that he
had taken the Buffel-headed Duck, seen at a distance, for this species,
as I am aware has been the case with other individuals.
</p>

<p>
The only specimen procured by me was shot by myself on Lake
Barataria, not far from New Orleans, in the winter of 1819. It was an
adult female in fine plumage. How it had wandered so far south is an
enigma to me; but having found it, and made a drawing of it on the spot,
I have taken the liberty to add one of the other sex from an equally
fine specimen. After all, the Smew can scarcely be considered as
belonging to the American Fauna, any more than our Fork-tailed Hawk
can with propriety be called a denizen of England; and in this I am
supported by all the great navigators of our Arctic Seas, such as <span class="smcap">Ross</span>,

<h2>
GADWALL DUCK.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Anas strepera</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXLVIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
I have met with this species along the whole of our Atlantic
coast, from Eastport in Maine to Texas. It is, however, more abundant
in the interior than in most of our maritime districts, and is
particularly so on the tributaries of the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi.
In the early part of autumn and late in spring many are found
on the margins of our great lakes. Yet the Gadwall has been represented
as not plentiful in the United States, probably on account of
its being generally dispersed, and not congregated in particular districts.
</p>

<p>
The Creoles of Louisiana name it “Violon,” on account of the
whistling sound of its wings. It arrives in the neighbourhood of New
Orleans and the mouths of the Mississippi along with the Widgeon,
and is fond of the company of the Red-head, to which it is about equal
as an article of food. The Gadwalls are usually seen in small flocks,
and during winter resort to the larger lakes and the pools in the interior
of the great marshes, adjoining the waters of the Gulf. In that
part of the country they feed on small fish, insects, and aquatic grasses.
Fewer of them are found in Massachusetts and the State of New York
than elsewhere, and this probably on account of these districts being
more elevated and less marshy than those farther south. My friend
Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> informs me that they are rather plentiful in South Carolina,
where they are considered good eating, and where they arrive in
the beginning of October, but are more frequently met with at that season,
and in early spring, than during winter, when a single individual
may sometimes be seen in a flock of other ducks.
</p>

<p>
While we were in the Texas, in the latter part of April and the
beginning of May, we found the Gadwall quite abundant on all the
inland ponds and streams, as well as on the brackish pools and inlets
of the islands and shores of Galveston Bay. Many of them had paired
and separated from the other ducks; and I was assured that this species
breeds there, as does the Dusky Duck, the Mallard, the Blue-winged Teal, 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
the Widgeon, and the Shoveller, the young of all these
species being plentiful in the end of June and beginning of July. I
was satisfied as to the truth of the repeated assurances I had received
on this subject, by observing the manners of individuals of all these
species before my departure from that country. After a continuance
of rainy weather, Gadwalls are found in great numbers on the vast
prairies of Oppelousas and Attacapas, where I have been told they
continue until very late in spring, and some remain to breed.
</p>

<p>
This species dives well on occasion, especially on being wounded.
At the appearance of danger, it rises on wing—whether from the ground
or from the water—at a single spring, in the manner of the Mallard,
and, like it also, ascends almost perpendicularly for several yards, after
which it moves off in a direct course with great celerity. I have never
seen it dive on seeing the flash of the gun; but when approached it always
swims to the opposite part of the pond, and, when the danger increases,
flies off. On being wounded, it sometimes by diving makes its
escape among the grass, where it squats and remains concealed. It walks
with ease, and prettily, often making incursions upon the land, when
the ponds are not surrounded by trees, for the purpose of searching for
food. It nibbles the tender shoots and blades of grasses with apparent
pleasure, and will feed on beech-nuts, acorns, and seeds of all kinds of
gramineæ, as well as on tadpoles, small fishes, and leeches. After
rain it alights in the corn-fields, like the Mallard, and picks up the
scattered grains of maize. The common notes or cry of the female
have a considerable resemblance to those of the female Mallard; but
the cry of the male is weaker as in that species.
</p>

<p>
It is by no means shy in the Western Country, where I have often
found it associating with other species, which would leave the pond
before it. Near the sea, however, it is much more wary, and this no
doubt on account of the greater number of persons who there follow
shooting as a regular and profitable employment. From the following
note of my friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, you may judge how easily this fine
species might be domesticated.
</p>

<p>
“In the year 1812 I saw in Dutchess County, in the State of New
York, at the house of a miller, a fine flock of ducks, to the number of
at least thirty, which, from their peculiar appearance, struck me as differing
from any I had before seen among the different varieties of the
tame Duck. On inquiry, I was informed that three years before, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
pair of these ducks had been captured in the mill pond, whether in a trap,
or by being wounded, I cannot recollect. They were kept in the
poultry-yard, and, it was said, were easily tamed. One joint of the
wing was taken off, to prevent their flying away. In the following
spring they were suffered to go into the pond, and they returned daily
to the house to be fed. They built their nest on the edge of the pond,
and reared a large brood. The young were perfectly reconciled to domestication,
and made no attempts, even at the migratory season, to
fly away, although their wings were perfect. In the following season
they produced large broods. The family of the miller used them occasionally
as food, and considered them equal in flavour to the common
duck, and more easily raised. The old males were more beautiful than
any that I have examined since; and as yet domestication had produced
no variety in their plumage.”
</p>

<p>
The migration of this species extends to the Fur Countries, where
it is said to breed. The description of a male killed on the Saskatchewan
River, on the 22d of May 1827, is given in the Fauna Boreali-Americana;
and I have a fine male procured by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> on the
Columbia River.

<span class="smcap"><i>Rallus jamaicensis</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCXLIX. Male and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
My knowledge of this pretty little species is altogether derived
from <span class="smcap">Titian Peale</span>, Esq., of Philadelphia, by whom, in October 1836,
I was favoured with the following letter:—
</p>

<p>
“I herewith send you the ‘Little Rail’ of which we were speaking
yesterday, and the letter of Dr <span class="smcap">Rowan</span> which relates to it. The young
died soon after I received them, but the old one lived with me until
the 26th of July (four days after its capture), evincing considerable
anxiety for the young, as long as they lived. Both young and old partook
sparingly of Indian meal and water, or bread and water, and soon
became quite at home, and probably might have been domesticated,
had they been properly accommodated.
</p>

<p>
“The most remarkable part of the history of this individual is, that
after its death we should have discovered in dissection that it was a
male, rendering it singularly curious that <i>he</i> should have suffered himself
to be captured by hand while in defence of the young brood.
</p>

<p>
“There is now in the Museum a specimen of this species, which has
been in the collection for about thirty years, said to have been caught
in the vicinity of the city. It stands labelled ‘Little Rail, <i>Rallus minutus</i>,
Turton’s Linn;’ but the authenticity of the specimen has always

“On Saturday last I wrote to you of the Rail Bird breeding near
this place. I then described one that I caught last summer, which
was unlike the Rail in the fall season, and I presumed that all in the
wet ground were the same, but this day my men mowing around the
pond started up two of the usual kind. The hen flew a few rods, and
then flew back to her young in an instant, when they caught her together
with her four young, which I herewith send you. Many more
can be caught. I have seen them in our meadow every month of the
year, but they never make a great noise except when very fat on the
wild oat’s seed. From the above you will conclude that they do not
migrate to the south, but breed here. Respectfully,

<p>
For the following brief account of this bird, I am indebted to my
learned and obliging friend, <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>.
</p>

<p>
“This remarkable species, so much allied to the <i>Charadrius Wilsoni</i>,
was scarcely seen by us for more than one or two days, and then
on the central table-land of the Rocky Mountains, in the plains near
the last of the streams of the Platte, pursued in our western and northern
route. It being the month of July when we saw it, there is little
doubt but that it was breeding in this subalpine region. The only individual
shot, was seen skulking and running through the wormwood
bushes which so generally clothe those arid and dry wastes. After
running some time, it would remain perfectly still, as if conscious of
the difficulty of distinguishing it from the colour of the grey soil on
which it stood. All that we saw were similar to the present individual,
and none, however flushed, took to the wing. We do not recollect
hearing from it the slightest complaint or note of any kind,
being intent probably on concealing its young or eggs by a perfect
silence.”
</p>

<p>
The skin from which I made my drawing was that of a female;
and it is my opinion, that the male, when found, will have as distinct
markings as those exhibited by <i>Charadrius melodus</i> or <i>Ch. semipalmatus</i>.

<h2>
GREAT CINEREOUS OWL.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Strix cinerea</i>, Gmelin.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLI.</span>
</p>


<p>
This fine Owl, which is the largest of the North American species,
is nowhere common with us, although it ranges from the north-eastern
coast of the United States to the sources of the Columbia River. It
has been procured near Eastport in Maine, and at Marble Head in
Massachusetts, where one of them was taken alive, perched on a
wood pile, early in the morning, in February 1831. I went to Salem
for the purpose of seeing it, but it had died, and I could not trace its
remains. The gentleman, Mr <span class="smcap">Ives</span>, in whose keeping it had been for
several months, fed it on fish and small birds, of which it was very fond.
Besides shewing me various marks of attention, he gave me a drawing
of it made by his wife, which is still in my possession. It uttered at
times a tremulous cry not unlike that of the Little Screech Owl, <i>Strix
Asio</i>, and shewed a great antipathy to cats and dogs. In the winter of
1832, I saw one of these Owls flying over the harbour of Boston, Massachusetts,
amid several Gulls, all of which continued teasing it until
it disappeared. I have seen specimens procured on the Rocky Mountains
by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, and several brought to London by the medical
officer who accompanied Captain <span class="smcap">Back</span> in his late Arctic journey.
Among the individuals which I have examined I have found considerable
differences as to size and markings, which may be attributed to age
and sex. My drawing was taken from a remarkably fine specimen in
the collection of the Zoological Society of London.
</p>

<p>
The comparatively small size of this bird’s eyes renders it probable
that it hunts by day, and the remarkable smallness of its feet and claws
induces me to think that it does not prey on large animals. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>
says that “it is by no means a rare bird in the Fur Countries, being
an inhabitant of all the woody districts, lying between Lake Superior
and latitudes 67° or 68°, and between Hudson’s Bay and the Pacific.
It is common on the borders of Great Bear Lake; and there, and in
the higher parallels of latitude, it must pursue its prey, during the
summer months, by day-light. It keeps however within the woods,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
and does not frequent the barren grounds, like the Snowy Owl, nor is
it so often met with in broad day light as the Hawk Owl, but hunts
principally when the sun is low; indeed, it is only at such times, when
the recesses of the woods are deeply shadowed, that the American hare
and the murine animals, on which the Cinereous Owl chiefly preys,
come forth to feed. On the 23d of May I discovered a nest of this
Owl, built on the top of a lofty balsam poplar, of sticks, and lined with
feathers. It contained three young, which were covered with a whitish
down. We got them by felling the tree, which was remarkably
thick; and whilst this operation was going on, the two parent birds
flew in circles round the objects of their cares, keeping, however, so
high in the air as to be out of gunshot; they did not appear to be dazzled
by the light. The young ones were kept alive for two months,
when they made their escape. They had the habit, common also to
other Owls, of throwing themselves back, and making a loud snapping
noise with their bills, when any one entered the room in which they
were kept.”

softer linear, denser feathers from the forehead, behind the ears, to the
chin. The conch of the ear is very large, although greatly exceeded
by that of many other Owls, and furnished with an anterior semicircular
operculum, beset with slender feathers. Wings very large, concave;
primaries, decurved toward the end, the first with the tips of
the filaments separated, and recurved in its whole length, the second

equals the next. The first five have their outer webs more or less cut
out towards the end, and the first seven have their inner webs sinuate.
The tail is long, ample, rounded, of twelve broad rounded feathers.
</p>

<p>
Bill yellow. Iris bright yellow. Claws brownish-black. The general
colour of the upper parts is greyish-brown, variegated with greyish-white
in irregular undulated markings; the feathers on the upper
part of the head with two transverse white spots on each web; the
smaller wing-coverts of a darker brown, and less mottled than the
back; the outer scapulars with more white on their outer webs; the
primary quills blackish-brown toward the end, marked in the rest of
their extent with few broad light-grey oblique bands, which are dotted
and undulated with darker. Tail-feathers similarly barred, darker towards
the end, the middle ones more intricately marked. The feathers
of the ruff are white towards the end, dark-brown in the centre.
The disks are on their inner side grey, with black tips; in the rest of
their extent greyish-white, with six bars of blackish-brown very regularly
disposed in a concentric manner; feathers on the chin or upper
part of throat greyish-white. All the under parts are greyish-brown,
variegated with greyish and yellowish white; the feet barred with the
same.

<h2>
BLACK-SHOULDERED HAWK.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Falco dispar</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
I have traced the migration of this beautiful Hawk from the Texas
as far east as the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina.
<span class="smcap">Charles Bonaparte</span> first introduced it into our Fauna, on the authority
of a specimen procured in East Florida, by <span class="smcap">Titian Peale</span>, Esq.
of Philadelphia, who it seems had some difficulty in obtaining it. On
the 8th of February 1834 I received one of these birds alive from Dr
<span class="smcap">Ravenel</span> of Charleston, who had kept it in his yard for eight days
previously, without being able to induce it to take any food. The
beauty of its large eyes struck me at once, and I immediately made
a drawing of the bird, which was the first I had ever seen alive.
It proved to be a male, and was in beautiful plumage. Dr <span class="smcap">Ravenel</span>
told me that it walked about his yard with tolerable ease, although
one of its wings had been injured. On the 23d of the same month I
received another fine specimen, a female, from <span class="smcap">Francis Lee</span>, Esq.,
who had procured it on his plantation, forty miles west of Charleston,
and with it the following note. “When first observed, it was perched
on a tree in an erect posture. I saw at once that it was one of the birds
which you had desired me to procure for you, and went to the house
for my gun. On returning I saw the Hawk very high in the air,
sailing beautifully over a large wet meadow, where many Common
Snipes were feeding. It would now and then poise itself for a while,
in the manner of our Little Sparrow Hawk, and suddenly closing its
wings plunge towards its prey with great velocity, making a rumbling
noise as it passed through the air. Now and then, when about half-way,
it suddenly checked its descent, recommenced hovering, and at last
marking its prey, rushed upon it and secured it. Its cries, on being
wounded, so much resembled those of the Mississippi Kite, that I
thought, as I was going to pick it up, that I had only got one of that
species. It was so shy that I was obliged to get on horseback before
I could approach it within gun shot.”
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">H. Ward</span>, who accompanied me on my expedition to the Floridas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
found this species breeding on the plantation of <span class="smcap">Alexander Mayzck</span>,
Esq., on the Santee River, early in the month of March, and shot three,
two of which, a male and a female, are now in my possession. Their
nests were placed on low trees near the margins of the river, and resembled
those of the American Crow, but had none of the substantial
lining of that bird’s nest. Mr <span class="smcap">Ward</span> states, that at this time they
were seen flying over the cane brakes in pursuit of large insects, somewhat
in the manner of the Mississippi Kite, and that they were very
shy.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> has seen this species fly in groups, at
a very great height, in the beginning of March, and thinks that it is
only of late years that they have located themselves in South Carolina,
where, however, five of them have been procured in one year.
</p>

<p>
The Black-shouldered Hawk appears to give a decided preference
to low lands, not distant from the shores of the Atlantic. On our way
toward the Texas, several of these birds were seen over the large marshes,
flying at a small elevation, and coursing in search of prey, much
in the manner of the Hen-harrier or Marsh Hawk, but all evidently
bent on proceeding to the eastward. Whether this species winters
there or not, I am unable to say, but that some remain all the year in
Florida, and even in South Carolina, I am quite confident.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the food of this species and that of the Mississippi
Kite is surprising to me. I have never seen the latter seize
any bird, whereas the Black-shouldered Hawk certainly does so, as in
the stomachs of two individuals which I examined were remains of
birds as well as of coleopterous insects. These two birds agree nearly
with the description of the one procured by Mr <span class="smcap">Titian Peale</span>, excepting
in the length of the wings, which in them and in several others
that have come under my notice, have their tips fully an inch shorter
than the end of the tail. A breeding female differed from the rest in
having the eyes dull yellowish-red; the tail-feathers had all been ash-grey,
all the primaries were edged with white, and many of the secondaries
were still of a light brownish-grey; the black spots under the
wings were smaller than usual; the abdomen was also tinged with
brownish-grey. I am therefore of opinion, that these birds undergo as
many changes of plumage as the Mississippi Kite.

<h2>
CHESTNUT-BACKED TITMOUSE.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Parus rufescens</i>, Townsend.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
You have before you on the same plate three species of <i>Parus</i>, two
of which are new to science. Of specimens of these I obtained possession
in consequence of the purchase which I made of part of Dr
<span class="smcap">Townsend</span>’s hard-earned collection, made during his laborious expedition
over the Rocky Mountains, and the valley of the Columbia River.
For an account of the habits of those which are not found to the east
of the Rocky Mountains, I am indebted to my friends <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>,
Esq., and <span class="smcap">J. K. Townsend</span>, M. D. Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s notice respecting
the present species is as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“The Chestnut-backed Titmouse is seen throughout the year in
the forests of the Columbia, and as far south as Upper California, in
all which tract it breeds, forming, as I have some reason to believe,
a pendulous, or at least an exposed nest, like some of the European
species. It is made of large quantities of hypna and lichens, and copiously
and coarsely lined with deer’s hair and large feathers, such as
those of the Grouse and the Jay. They are commonly seen in small
flocks of all ages in the autumn and winter, when they move about
briskly, and emit a number of feeble querulous notes, after the manner
of the Chickadee, or common species, <i>Parus atricapillus</i>, but seldom
utter any thing like a song, though now and then, as they glean about,
they utter a <i>t’she</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>de</i>, or <i>t’dee</i>, <i>t’dee</i>, <i>dee</i>, their more common querulous
call, however, being like <i>t’she</i>, <i>dé</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>vait</i>, <i>t’she</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>vait</i>, sometimes
also a confused warbling chatter. The busy troop, accompanied
often by the common species, the <i>Regulus tricolor</i>, and the small yellow-bellied
<i>Parus</i>, are seen flitting through bushes and thickets, carefully
gleaning insects and larvæ for an instant, and are then off to some
other place around, proceeding with restless activity to gratify the
calls of hunger and the stimulus of caprice. Thus they are seen to
rove along for miles together, until satisfied or fatigued, when they retire
to rest in the recesses of the darkest forests, situations which they
eventually choose for their temporary domicile, where in solitude and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
retirement they rear their young, and for the whole of the succeeding
autumn and winter remain probably together in families. When the
gun thins their ranks, it is surprising to see the courage, anxiety, and
solicitude of these little creatures: they follow you with their wailing
scold, and entreat for their companions in a manner that impresses
you with a favourable idea of their social feelings and sympathy.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> says, that “the Chinook Indians call this species <i>a
kul</i>. It inhabits the forests of the Columbia River, where it breeds and
goes in flocks in the autumn, more or less gregarious through the season.
The legs and feet are light blue.”

<h2>
BLACK-CAP TITMOUSE.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Parus atricapillus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The opinion generally entertained respecting the extensive dispersion
of the Black-cap Titmouse, has in all probability originated
from the great resemblance which it bears to the Carolina Titmouse,
<i>Parus Carolinensis</i>, described at p. 341 of the second volume of this
work; that species being now known to extend its spring and summer
migrations as far eastward as the State of New Jersey, where it has
been found breeding by my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, Esq. of Moorestown.
The Black-cap, on the other hand, is rarely observed farther
south, and then only in winter, when it proceeds as far as beyond the
middle portions of Maryland, from whence I have at that season received
specimens in spirits, collected by my friend Colonel <span class="smcap">Theodore
Anderson</span> of Baltimore. Westward of the Alleghanies it extends as
far as Kentucky in winter, but at the approach of spring returns northward.
In Pennsylvania and New Jersey some are known to breed;
but as the Carolina Titmouse breeds there also, it is difficult to say
which of them is the most numerous, they being so like each other
that one is apt to confound them. In the State of New York it is
abundant, and often rears two broods in the season; as you proceed
eastward you may observe it in all places favourable to its habits; and,
according to Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, it is found as far north as Lat. 65°, it
being in the Fur Countries the most common bird, “a small family inhabiting
almost every thicket.” None were seen by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>
either on the Rocky Mountains or about the Columbia River, where,
on the contrary, <i>Parus Carolinensis</i> is abundant, as it is also in the Texas,
where I found it breeding in the spring of 1837. Although bearing a
considerable resemblance to the Marsh Titmouse of Europe, <i>P. palustris</i>,
it differs from that species not only in colour, but more especially
in its habits and notes.
</p>

<p>
Hardy, smart, restless, industrious, and frugal, the Black-cap Titmouse
ranges through the forest during the summer, and retiring to its
more secluded parts, as if to ensure a greater degree of quiet, it usually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
breeds there. Numerous eggs produce a numerous progeny, and
as soon as the first brood has been reared, the young range hither and
thither in a body, searching for food, while their parents, intent on forming
another family, remain concealed and almost silent, laying their
eggs in the hole deserted by some small Woodpecker, or forming one
for themselves. As it has been my fortune to witness a pair at this
work, I will here state what occurred, notwithstanding the opinion of
those who inform us that the bill of a Titmouse is “not shaped for
digging.” While seated one morning under a crab-apple tree (very
hard wood, Reader), I saw two Black-cap Titmice fluttering about in
great concern, as if anxious to see me depart. By their manners indeed
I was induced to believe that their nest was near, and, anxious to
observe their proceedings, I removed to the distance of about twenty
paces.  The birds now became silent, alighted on the apple-tree, gradually
moved towards the base of one of its large branches, and one of
them disappeared in what I then supposed to be the hole of some small
Woodpecker; but I saw it presently on the edge, with a small chip in
its bill, and again cautiously approached the tree. When three or four
yards off I distinctly heard the peckings or taps of the industrious
worker within, and saw it come to the mouth of the hole and return
many times in succession in the course of half an hour, after which I
got up and examined the mansion. The hole was about three inches
deep, and dug obliquely downward from the aperture, which was just
large enough to admit the bird. I had observed both sexes at this
labour, and left the spot perfectly satisfied as to their power of boring
a nest for themselves.
</p>

<p>
The Black-cap Titmouse, or Chickadee, as it is generally named in
our Eastern States, though exceedingly shy in summer or during the
breeding season, becomes quite familiar in winter, although it never
ventures to enter the habitations of man; but in the most boisterous
weather, requiring neither food nor shelter there, it may be seen amidst
the snow in the rugged paths of the cheerless woods, where it welcomes
the traveller or the woodcutter with a confidence and cheerfulness
far surpassing the well-known familiarity of the Robin Redbreast
of Europe. Often, on such occasions, should you offer it, no
matter how small a portion of your fare, it alights without hesitation,
and devours it without manifesting any apprehension. The sound
of an axe in the woods is sufficient to bring forth several of these busy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>
creatures, and having discovered the woodman, they seem to find
pleasure in his company. If, as is usually the case, he is provided
with a dinner, the Chickadee at once evinces its anxiety to partake
of it, and loses no opportunity of accomplishing its object, although
it sets about it with much circumspection, as if it were afraid of being
detected, and brought to punishment, A woodcutter in Maine assured
me, that one day he happened to be at work, and had scarcely hung
up his basket of provisions, when it was observed by a flock of these
birds, which, having gathered into it at once, attacked a piece of cold
beef; but after each peck, he saw their heads raised above the edge,
as if to guard against the least appearance of danger. After picking
until they were tired or satisfied, they left the basket and perched directly
over his fire, but out of the direction of the smoke. There they
sat enjoying themselves and ruffling their feathers to allow the warmth
more easy access to their skin, until he began his dinner, when they
immediately alighted near him, and in the most plaintive tones seemed
to solicit a portion.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> and others have spoken of this species as being addicted to
moving in the company of our smaller Woodpeckers and Brown Creepers,
and this in such a way as to induce most readers to believe the act to
be customary; but I have often found groups of them, at times composed
of more than a dozen, without any such companions, and I should
be more inclined to think that the Downy Woodpecker, and the Brown
Creeper, seek the company of the Titmice, rather than that the latter
associate with them. Often indeed have I watched the busy Chickadees,
as they proceeded from tree to tree, and from branch to branch,
whether by the road-side or in the interior of the forest, when no other
birds were with them. The light rustling sound of their concave wings
would intimate their approach as well as their retreat, as gaily one after
another they passed onwards from one spot to another, chattering,
peeping everywhere, and determined as it were, not to suffer a chink
to pass without inspection. Now hanging, back downward, at the extremity
of a twig, its feet almost up to its bill, it would peck at a berry
or a seed until it had devoured it, or it had fallen to the ground:
should the latter be the case, the busy bird would at once fly down, and
hammer at the fruit. To the Black-cap Titmouse the breaking of a hazel
nut is quite a pleasure, and I have repeatedly seen the feat accomplished
not only by a bird in its natural state, but by one kept in confinement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
Courageous and at times exceedingly tyrannical, it will attack young
birds, break their skulls, and feed upon their flesh, as I have more than
once witnessed. In this habit they resemble the Jays, but in every
other they differ entirely from those birds, although the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>
has thought fit to assimilate the two groups. The Chickadee
feeds on insects, their larvæ, and eggs, as well as on every sort of small
fruit, or berries, including grapes, acorns, and the seeds of various
pines. I have seen them eat the seeds of the sunflower, the poke-berry,
and pears, as well as flesh of all kinds. Indeed it may be truly
called omnivorous. Often, like Jays, you may see them perched as it
were upon their food, and holding it beneath their feet while pecking at
it; but no Jays are seen to hang head downwards at the end of a branch.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas M’Culloch</span>, Esq. of Pictou, in Nova Scotia, has
favoured me with the following interesting remarks having reference to
this species. “Sometimes I have been inclined to think, that the sight
of this bird is comparatively imperfect, and that it is chiefly indebted
to some of the other senses for its success in obtaining subsistence.
This idea may not be correct, but it seems to derive some support from
the little incident which I am about to mention. While standing at
the edge of a patch of newly-felled wood, over which the fire had recently
passed, and left every thing black in its course, I observed a
small flock of these birds coming from the opposite side of the clearing.
Being dressed in black and aware of their familiarity, I stood perfectly
motionless, for the purpose of ascertaining how near they would approach.
Stealing from branch to branch, and peering for food among
the crevices of the prostrate trunks, as they passed along, onward they
came until the foremost settled upon a small twig a few feet from the
spot upon which I stood. After looking about for a short time it flew
and alighted just below the lock of a double-barrelled gun which I held
in a slanting direction below my arm. Being unable however to obtain
a hold, it slided down to the middle of the piece, and then flew
away, jerking its tail, and apparently quite unconscious of having been
so near the deadly weapon. In this country these birds seem to be influenced
by a modification of that feeling by which so many others are
induced to congregate at the close of autumn and seek a more congenial
clime. At that period they collect in large flocks and exhibit all
the hurry and bustle of travellers, who are bent upon a distant journey.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
If these flocks do not migrate, their union is soon destroyed, for when
the Black-cap Titmice again appear, it is in small flocks; their former
restlessness is gone, and they now exhibit their wonted care and deliberation
in searching for food.”
</p>

<p>
The nest of this species, whether it be placed in the hole of a Woodpecker
or Squirrel, or in a place dug by itself, is seldom found at a height
exceeding ten feet. Most of those which I have seen were in low
broken or hollowed stumps only a few feet high. The materials of
which it is composed vary in different districts, but are generally the
hair of quadrupeds, in a considerable quantity, and disposed in the
shape of a loose bag or purse, as in most other species which do
not hang their nests outside. Some persons have said that they lay
their eggs on the bare wood, or on the chips left by Woodpeckers; but
this is not the case, in so far as I have examined them; and in this my
observations are confirmed by those of Dr <span class="smcap">Brewer</span> of Boston and Mr
<span class="smcap">M’Culloch</span> of Pictou, who also have inspected nests of this species.
The eggs rarely exceed eight in number; they measure five-eighths of
an inch in length, by three-eighths and three-quarters, are rather pointed
at the smaller end, white, slightly sprinkled with minute dots and
markings of light reddish. Those of the first brood are deposited from
the middle of April to that of May; for the second about two months
later. The parents I have thought generally move along with the young
of the second brood.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Brewer</span> says, “on the 20th of June, I found in a single Titmouse’s
hole a mass of the hair of the Common Skunk and moss large
enough to weigh two or more ounces, and sufficient to construct a nest
for some of our larger birds, such for instance as Wilson’s Thrush.”
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">M’Culloch</span> found a nest of this bird placed about two feet
from the ground in a small stump, which seemed to have been excavated
by the birds themselves. It contained six young, and was lined
entirely with the hair which cattle, in rubbing themselves, had left
upon the stump.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species, like that of all our American Titmice, is
short, fluttering, generally only from tree to tree, and is accompanied
with a murmuring sound produced by the concavity of the wings. It
is seldom seen on the ground, unless when it has followed a fruit that
has fallen, or when searching for materials for its nest. It usually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' href='#Page_379'>379</a></span>
roosts in its nest during winter, and in summer amid the close foliage
of firs or evergreens. In winter, indeed, as well as often in autumn,
it is seen near the farm-houses, and even in villages and towns, busily
seeking for food among the trees.
</p>

<p>
“On seeing a cat, or other object of natural antipathy,” says Mr
<span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, “the Chickadee, like the peevish Jay, scolds in a loud, angry,
and hoarse note, <i>’tshe</i>, <i>dáigh dáigh dáigh</i>. Among the other notes of
this species, I have heard a call like <i>tshe-de-jay</i>, <i>tshe-de-jay</i>, the two first
syllables being a slender chirp, with the <i>jay</i> strongly pronounced.
The only note of this bird which may be called a song, is one which is
frequently heard at intervals in the depths of the forest, at times of
day usually when all other birds are silent. We then may sometimes
hear in the midst of this solitude two feeble, drawling, clearly whistled,
and rather melancholy notes like <i>’te-dĕrry</i>, and sometimes <i>ye-pĕrrit</i>,
and occasionally, but more rarely in the same wiry, whistling, solemn
tone, <i>’phēbé</i>. The young in winter also sometimes drawl out these
contemplative strains. In all cases the first syllable is very high and
clear, the second word drops low, and ends like a feeble plaint. This
is nearly all the quaint song ever attempted by the Chickadee. On fine
days, about the commencement of October, I have heard the Chickadee
sometimes, for half an hour at a time, attempt a lively, petulant
warble, very different from his ordinary notes. On these occasions he
appears to flirt about, still hunting for his prey, in an ecstacy of delight
and vigour. But after a while the usual drawling note again occurs.
These birds, like many others, are very subject to the attacks of vermin,
and they accumulate in great numbers around that part of the
head and front which is least accessible to their foot.”

with the dorsal line slightly convex, the sides sloping and convex,
the edges sharp, that of the upper mandible slightly sinuate.
Nostrils basal, roundish, concealed by the recumbent feathers. Head
large, neck short, body robust. Feet of ordinary length, rather robust;
tarsus compressed, with seven anterior scutella; toes large, the three
anterior united as far as the second joint; the hind one much stronger,
and with its claw nearly as long as the middle toe. Claws large,
arched, much compressed, acute.

<p>
Plumage blended, tufty; feathers of the head glossy. Wings of
moderate length, the first quill scarcely half the length of the second,
which is equal to the first secondary, the third and seventh about
equal, the fourth and fifth equal and longest.  Tail long, a little
arched, emarginate and rounded, of twelve slender rounded feathers.
</p>

<p>
Bill brownish-black. Iris dark brown. Feet greyish-blue, as are
the claws. The whole upper part of the head and the hind neck pure
black, as is a large patch on the throat and fore-neck. Between these
patches of black is a band of white, from the base of the bill down the
sides of the neck, becoming broader behind, and encroaching on the
back, which, with the wing-coverts, is ash-grey tinged with brown.
Quills dark greyish-brown, margined with bluish-white, the secondary
quills so broadly margined as to leave a conspicuous white dash on
the wing; tail of the same colour, the feathers similarly edged. Lower
parts brownish-white, the sides pale yellowish-brown.

CHESTNUT-CROWNED TITMOUSE.

<p class="undertitle">

<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s account of this Titmouse is as follows, “We
first observed the arrival of this plain and diminutive species on the
banks of the Wahlamet, near to its confluence with the Columbia, about
the middle of May. Hopping about in the hazel thickets which border
the alluvial meadows of the river, they appeared very intent and industriously
engaged in quest of small insects, chirping now and then a
slender call of recognition. They generally flew off in pairs, but were
by no means shy, and kept always in the low bushes or the skirt of the
woods. The following day I heard the males utter a sort of weak
monotonous short and quaint song, and about a week afterwards I had
the good fortune to find the nest, about which the male was so particularly
solicitous as almost unerringly to draw me to the spot, where
hung from a low bush, about 4 feet from the ground, his little curious
mansion, formed like a long purse, with a round hole for entrance near
the summit. It was made chiefly of moss, down, lint of plants, and
lined with some feathers. The eggs, six in number, were pure white,
and already far gone towards being hatched. I saw but few other
pairs in this vicinity, but on the 21st of June, in the dark woods near
Fort Vancouver, I again saw a flock of about twelve, which, on making
a chirp something like their own call, came around me very familiarly,
and kept up a most incessant and querulous chirping. The following
season (April 1836) I saw numbers of these birds in the mountain
thickets around Santa Barbara, in Upper California, where they again
seemed untiringly employed in gleaning food in the low bushes, picking
up or catching their prey in all postures, sometimes like the common
Chickadee, head downwards, and letting no cranny or corner escape
their unwearied search. As we did not see them in the winter, they
migrate in all probability throughout Mexico and the Californian peninsula
at this season.”
</p>

<p>
According to Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, “the Chinooks name it <i>a-ha-ke-lok</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
It is a constant resident about the Columbia River; hops about in the
bushes, and frequently hangs from the twigs in the manner of other
Titmice, twittering all the while with a rapid enunciation resembling
the words <i>thshish</i>, <i>tshist</i>, <i>tsee</i>, <i>twee</i>. The irides are bright yellow.”

</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> was the first ornithologist who figured this handsome bird.
From his time until the return of Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> from the Columbia
River no specimen seems to have been procured. That gentleman forwarded
several males in much finer condition than those brought by
<span class="smcap">Lewis</span> and <span class="smcap">Clarke</span>. Some of these I purchased, and, on his return
to Philadelphia, I was presented with a female by my young friend
Dr <span class="smcap">Trudeau</span>, of Louisiana, a representation of which you will find
in Plate CCCC. fig 4. The only account of this species is by <span class="smcap">Thomas
Nuttall</span>, who, however, was unacquainted with the female.
</p>

<p>
“We first observed this fine bird in a thick belt of wood near Lorimier’s
Fork of the Platte, on the 4th of June, at a considerable distance
to the east of the first chain of the Rocky Mountains (or Black
Hills), so that the species in all probability continues some distance
down the Platte. We have also seen them very abundant in the spring,
in the forests of the Columbia, below Fort Vancouver. On the Platte
they appeared shy and almost silent, not having there apparently commenced
breeding. About the middle of May we observed the males
in small numbers scattered through the dark pine forests of the Columbia,
restless, shy, and flitting when approached, but at length more
sedentary when mated. We frequently traced them out by their song,
which is a loud, short, slow, but pleasing warble, not much unlike the
song of the Common Robin, delivered from the tops of the lofty fir-trees.
This music continues at short intervals throughout the whole
forenoon, during which time our songster is busily engaged in quest of
such coleopterous insects and larvæ as are to be found on the young
branches of the trees he frequents, and which require an assiduous and
long-continued search to gratify his wants. Of the female and nest
we are still ignorant, though they are in all probability very similar to
those of our other known species.  We have not seen this bird as far
south as Upper California, though it may exist in the thicker forests remote
from the coast, which we had no opportunity of visiting.”

<h2>
SCARLET TANAGER.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tanagra rubra</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLIV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
You have now before you representations of one of the most richly
coloured of our birds, and one whose history is in some degree peculiar.
The Scarlet Tanager enters the United States from Mexico,
through the Texas, in the beginning of April. On several of the
islands in the Bay of Mexico, I found it exceedingly abundant, and restrained
in a great measure from proceeding eastward by the weather,
which was unseasonably cold. Many were procured in their full dress,
and a few in the garb of the females. These plain-coloured individuals
turned all out to be males, which in so far confirmed my former observations
respecting this and several other species, in which the males
precede the females by about a fortnight in their spring migrations. It
was at the same period that I observed the wonderful rapidity in the
change of the plumage from its winter aspect to its summer colouring,
in the Red-breasted Snipe, <i>Scolopax Noveboracensis</i>; and I became convinced
that nearly the same phenomenon took place in the Tanagers.
In them, in fact, the older individuals, being stronger, had attained
their full colouring, while the younger were later in changing. As
we advanced, I procured many specimens partially coloured, and when
the males had mostly passed, the females made their appearance; manifesting
similar gradations in the changes of their colours. I knew that
many of the males of this species reach our Middle Districts in a spotted
dress, and soon after acquire their full colours; and I am disposed to
think that in the autumnal months, the young males of the year become
of a much purer tint than that of the young or old females. The
latter themselves improve materially in this respect as they advance
in age, and I have some nearly twice as richly coloured as birds only a
year old. The same observations apply to our Summer Red Bird,
<i>Tanagra æstiva</i>, of which I have females, procured by my valued
friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, Esq., exhibiting tints nearly as bright as
those of their mates obtained at the same time, when they had nests.
In the Scarlet Tanager it is remarkable, moreover, that some males
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' href='#Page_389'>389</a></span>
acquire a beautiful transverse band of glowing red on the smaller
wing-coverts; and I have several specimens in this state, presented to
me by Mr <span class="smcap">Harris</span> and Dr <span class="smcap">Trudeau</span>.
</p>

<p>
The Scarlet Tanager proceeds as far northward as Lake Huron,
where it was observed by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>; but this must happen rarely,
as it is very sensible to cold, so much so indeed, that in the State of Massachusetts,
should a sudden change take place in the weather, during the
time of their spring migrations, hundreds die in the course of a night, not
only in the woods and orchards, but even in the towns and villages. I
witnessed a like occurrence at Eastport in Maine late in May, when I was
on my way to Labrador; and as I was proceeding to the Texas, I observed
that they sought the shelter of the low bushes, when the weather
was damp or chill. None were seen after we left the former place,
though they are at times found breeding in the British provinces of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In the United States they seem extremely
partial to certain districts, generally preferring sandy soils and
undulating grounds. Thus, I found them breeding abundantly in Louisiana,
but rarely there in the lower parts. My friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>
informs me that they are seldom met with in the maritime districts of
South Carolina, and that there they follow the mountain range as it
were for a guide. Yet they are plentiful in the Jerseys, where they
usually arrive about the middle of May, in Kentucky, and along the
Missouri; and, in short, are generally dispersed over the Union.
</p>

<p>
The migrations of this species are performed by night. Its flight
on ordinary occasions is even and swift, and it passes through the woods
in a gliding manner, when the glowing colours on the males render them
as conspicuous as pleasing to the sight. On the branches their movements
are rather sedate, and it is but seldom that they emit their
usual notes when in motion. These are by no means musical, although
oft repeated. They have been well imitated by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, who represents
them by the syllables “<i>chip</i>, <i>churr</i>.” I have not, however, thought
them pensive in any degree, but rather lively: and when emitting
them, the bird often inflates his throat, stands erect, and vibrates his
body, as if in perfect ecstacy.
</p>

<p>
It is by no means true, as authors allege, that the Scarlet Tanager
retires from the sight of man, and prefers the deepest recesses of the
forest to the neighbourhood of the husbandman’s cottage; at least,
this is not the case in those parts of our country where the population
is not very dense; for I have observed it to take up its abode for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
season in the very vicinity of the squatter’s cabin, to the patch of open
ground near which it constantly resorted to search for coleoptera and
other insects, forming its slightly-built nest on the lower branch of a
spreading oak, or on a tree close to the road-side. It is composed externally
of a few dry weeds and small twigs, and scantily lined with
fibrous roots or slender grasses. In Louisiana the eggs are deposited
by the first of May, about a month later in our central districts, but
in the State of Maine frequently not until the middle of June. It never
raises more than one brood in the season; and I have observed that,
notwithstanding the difference in the temperature of our Southern and
Northern States, the young are no sooner able to travel than they are at
once led off, so that families may be seen travelling southward for
many weeks in succession, and by the end of September all have left
the United States. The eggs are from three to five, smooth, of a
dull greenish-blue colour, speckled with reddish-brown and light purple,
and measure a little more than 7 eighths of an inch in length, by 5
eighths in breadth. The young are fed with insects and fruits of many
sorts. At this period the old birds feed also on insects and larvæ, but
toward the latter period of their stay they all subsist chiefly on the
smaller berries and grapes.
</p>

<p>
The parental affection of this bird has been so beautifully and truly
described by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, that, in presenting the following statement regarding
it, I must contribute to the gratification of your kindly feelings
as much as of my own. “Passing through an orchard one morning,
I caught one of the young birds that had but lately left the nest.
I carried it with me about half a mile, to shew it to my friend, Mr
<span class="smcap">William Bartram</span>; and, having procured a cage, hung it upon one of
the large pine trees in the Botanic Garden, within a few feet of the
nest of an Orchard Oriole, which also contained young; hopeful that
the charity or tenderness of the Orioles would induce them to supply
the cravings of the stranger. But charity with them, as with too
many of the human race, began and ended at home. The poor orphan
was altogether neglected, notwithstanding its plaintive cries; and, as
it refused to be fed by me, I was about to return it back to the place
where I found it, when, towards the afternoon, a Scarlet Tanager, no
doubt its own parent, was seen fluttering round the cage, endeavouring
to get in. Finding this impracticable, he flew off, and soon returned
with food in his bill; and continued to feed it till after sunset, taking
up his lodgings on the higher branches of the same tree. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
morning, almost as soon as day broke, he was again seen most actively
engaged in the same affectionate manner; and, notwithstanding the
insolence of the Orioles, continued his benevolent offices the whole day,
roosting at night as before. On the third or fourth day, he appeared
extremely solicitous for the liberation of his charge, using every expression
of distressful anxiety, and every call and invitation that nature
had put in his power, for him to come out. This was too much
for the feelings of my venerable friend; he procured a ladder, and,
mounting to the spot where the bird was suspended, opened the cage,
took out the prisoner, and restored him to liberty and to his parent,
who, with notes of great exultation, accompanied his flight to the
woods. The happiness of my good friend was scarcely less complete,
and shewed itself in his benevolent countenance; and I could not refrain
saying to myself,—If such sweet sensations can be derived from
a single circumstance of this kind, how exquisite—how unspeakably
rapturous—must the delight of those individuals have been, who have
rescued their fellow beings from death, chains, and imprisonment, and
restored them to the arms of their friends and relations! Surely in such
godlike actions, virtue is its own most abundant reward.”

MACGILLIVRAY’S FINCH.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fringilla Macgillivraii.</i></span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Whilst <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>’s Finch resides in the pine forests of the Carolinas
and other Southern States, preferring dry and sandy lands covered
with grasses; and whilst <span class="smcap">Henslow</span>’s Bunting or Finch, and the Yellow-winged
Bunting, are fond of open prairies and ploughed fields, in
which they nestle; the species, on which I have bestowed the name of
my friend <span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>, chooses for its residence the salt marshes of
our Southern Atlantic shores, in which also are found the Sharp-tailed
and Seaside Finches of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> and other authors. The three former
spend the greater part of the winter in the forests, perch occasionally
on trees, and feed principally on seeds; whereas the latter three
are never found elsewhere than in the salt marshes, and feed chiefly on
minute shells and aquatic insects. Were I therefore to adopt the minimum
generic groups which have become prevalent, I would place the
three birds of the interior in a genus apart from that containing the
three marsh-birds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>’s Finch is as yet very rare within the United States,
and has not been observed farther eastward than Sullivan Island, about
six miles from Charleston in South Carolina; but it is very abundant
in the Texas, occurring on all the low islands that are much intersected
by salt-water bayous, and interspersed with ponds of brackish water,
seldom leaving these localities unless whilst travelling, or passing from
one island to another, which they do by flying at the height of only a
few feet above the surface. They run among the rankest weeds with
uncommon celerity, and do not seem to mind being followed by a dog,
which they very easily elude amongst the thick grass. Whilst breeding
they often start from a little distance, and pursue a singularly irregular
or zigzag flight, much resembling that of the Jack Snipe of
Europe, and yet performed with apparently slow beats of the wings.
They fall as it were among the grass as suddenly as they rise from it,
and by these manœuvres save their nests from the searching eye of
the keenest student of nature. They very seldom alight on the stems
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
of grasses, although when they do they climb with facility, occasionally
using their tail as a support, in the same manner as the Rice-bird.
Their strong tarsi and toes enable them to walk on the ground with
great vigour. When they take wing deliberately, their flight resembles
that of a young partridge, and, if over the land, is seldom extended
between forty or fifty yards at a time. The males appear very jealous
of each other, and frequently one pursues another on wing, but usually
abandons the chase before the conquered bird has alighted, leaving it
to pursue its course as it pleases after it has been driven beyond the
assailant’s jurisdiction. The notes of this species are few and unmusical,
consisting of a sort of roll of five or six syllables, which it
seems to me impossible to imitate. They are usually heard early in
the morning. My friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> informs me that none of these
Finches remain in South Carolina during winter, and that they generally
disappear early in November, when the weather is still very pleasant
in the maritime portions of that state. Many, however, spend
the winter in the salt marshes about the mouths of the Mississippi,
and I have no doubt that they are constant residents there, as they
are in the Texas.

<h2>
MARSH HAWK.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Falco cyaneus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLVI.</span>
</p>


<p>
With ease and elegance of flight, guided by an uncommon acuteness
of what I would call short-sightedness, the Marsh Hawk, like an
experienced gleaner, ranges over the wide extent of the prairie. The
pure white of the hind part of the female’s back, and the pale blue of
the male, attract your eye so long as the pair remain within sight. The
diligence and industry which they exhibit remind you of the search of
a well-trained pointer.
</p>

<p>
This species visits the greater part of the United States. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>
procured some specimens in latitude 65° north, and Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>
found it on the plains of the Columbia River, as well as on the
extensive prairies bordering on the Missouri. I have met with it in
Newfoundland and Labrador on the one hand, in Texas on the other,
and in every intermediate portion of the country.
</p>

<p>
In the Fauna Boreali-Americana, Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span> has published an excellent
paper relating to such birds as have and have not been considered
as identical with this bird and the European one bearing the same
name. I perfectly agree with that gentleman when he says that “the
typical structure of the wing in the present group must unquestionably
be that most prevalent among the species. It must, however, be remembered,
that even this character is subject to variation, according to
the age and perhaps the locality of the bird, and that it must not be insisted
upon with too much rigour.” I regret that this learned ornithologist
did not introduce the word <i>sex</i> into the above well-founded remark,
as in the sexes of birds, as well as in individuals of different
ages, remarkable differences are often observed.
</p>

<p>
It is to <span class="smcap">Montagu</span> that we are indebted for our first knowledge of
the differences that exist between the male and the female of the European
Hen Harrier, with which <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> believed the Marsh Hawk of
America to be identical. The Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>, in his continuation
of Wilson’s American Ornithology, also considered these birds as the
same; although he has since altered his opinion. For my part, having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
carefully observed the habits, and compared specimens of both, I have
come to the conclusion of their being the same species.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Marsh Hawk, although light and elegant, cannot
be said to be either swift or strong; but it is well sustained, and this
may be accounted for on comparing the small size and weight of its
body with the great extent of its wings and tail, which are proportionally
larger than those of any other American Hawk. While searching
for prey, it performs most of its rambles by rather irregular sailings;
by which I mean that it frequently deviates from a straight course
peeping hither and thither among the tall grasses of the marshes, prairies,
or meadows, or along the briary edges of our fields. It is seldom indeed
seen to chase birds on wing, although I have met with a few instances;
nor is it much in the habit of carrying its quarry to any distance;
for generally as it observes an object suited to its appetite, it
suddenly checks its speed, and almost poising itself by a few flaps of
its wings, drops with astonishing quickness on its unfortunate victim,
which it usually tears to pieces and devours on the spot. If disappointed,
however, it rises as quickly as it dropped, and proceeds as before.
Whilst engaged in feeding, it may very easily be approached, surprised,
and shot, by an experienced sportsman, for it rises in a flurried
manner, and generally cuts a few curious zigzags at the outset. To
obtain it, one has only to mark the spot with accuracy, keep his eye
upon it, and advance with his gun in readiness, for he will probably
get within a few yards before the bird rises. I have frequently seen
it shot in this manner. At other times, by watching its beats over a
field or meadow, one may obtain a good opportunity by concealing himself
near a spot where he has seen it miss its object, as it is sure to repass
there in a short time, at all events before it removes to another field.
When wounded and brought to the ground, it makes off on the approach
of its enemy by great leaps, and at times so swiftly that great
exertion is requisite to overtake it; and when this is accomplished,
it throws itself on its back, strikes furiously, and can inflict pretty
severe wounds with its very sharp claws.
</p>

<p>
This species flies very high at times, and in a direct course, as if
intent on proceeding to some great distance; but as I observed that
this frequently occurred when the bird was satiated with food, I have
thought that it preferred this method of favouring digestion, to its more
usual mode of sitting on the top of a fence rail, and there remaining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_398' href='#Page_398'>398</a></span>
quiet until again roused by the feeling of hunger. I have often seen
it, after sailing about in circles for a long while, half-close its wings,
and come towards the ground, cutting curious zigzags, until within a
few feet of it, when it would resume its usual elegant and graceful
mode of proceeding.
</p>

<p>
I have observed it in our western prairies in autumn moving in
flocks of twenty, thirty, or even so many as forty individuals, and appearing
to be migrating, as they passed along at a height of fifty or
sixty yards, without paying any attention to the objects below; but
on all these occasions I could never find that they were bent on any
general course more than another; as some days a flock would be proceeding
southward, on the next to the northward or eastward. Many
times I have seen them follow the grassy margins of our great streams,
such as the Ohio and Mississippi, at the approach of winter, as if bent
on going southward, but have become assured that they were merely
attracted by the vast multitudes of Finches or Sparrows of various sorts
which are then advancing in that direction.
</p>

<p>
In winter, the notes which the Marsh Hawk emits while on wing,
are sharp, and sound like the syllables <i>pee</i>, <i>pee</i>, <i>pee</i>, the first slightly
pronounced, the last louder, much prolonged, and ending plaintively.
During the love-season, its cry more resembles that of our Pigeon
Hawk; especially when the males meet, they being apparently tenacious
of their assumed right to a certain locality, as well as to the female of
their choice.
</p>

<p>
The Marsh Hawk breeds in many parts of the United States, as
well as beyond our limits to the north and south in which it finds a place
suited to its habits; as is the case with the Blue-winged Teal, and several
other species, which have until now been supposed to retreat to high
latitudes for the purpose. That many make choice of the more northern
regions, and return southward in autumn, is quite certain; but in
all probability an equal number remain within the confines of the United
States to breed.
</p>

<p>
It is by no means restricted to the low lands of the sea-shores
during the breeding season, for I have found its nest in the Barrens
of Kentucky, and even on the cleared table-lands of the Alleghany
Mountains and their spurs. In one instance, I found it in the high-covered
pine-barrens of the Floridas, although I have never seen one on
a tree; and the few cases of its nest having been placed on low trees
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>399</a></span>
or bushes, may have been caused by the presence of dangerous quadrupeds,
or their having been more than once disturbed or robbed of
their eggs or young, when their former nests had been placed on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Many birds of this species breed before they have obtained their
full plumage. I have several times found a male bird in brown plumage
paired with a female which had eggs; but such a circumstance is
not singular, for the like occurs in many species of different families.
I have never met with a nest in situations like those described by some
European writers as those in which the Hen-harrier breeds; but usually
on level parts of the country, or flat pieces of land that are sometimes
met with in hilly districts. As I am well aware, however, that
birds adapt the place and even the form and materials of their nests to
circumstances, I cannot admit that such a difference is by any means
sufficient to prove that birds similar in all other respects, are really different
from each other. If it be correct, as has been stated, that the male of
the European bird deserts the female, as soon as incubation commences,
this indeed would form a decided difference; but as such a habit has
not been observed in any other Hawk, it requires to be confirmed.
Our Marsh Hawks, after being paired, invariably keep together, and
labour conjointly for the support of their family, until the young are
left to shift for themselves. This is equally the case with every Hawk
with which I am acquainted.
</p>

<p>
Having considerable doubts as to whether any American writer who
has spoken of the Marsh Hawk ever saw one of its nests, I will here
describe one found on Galveston Island by my son <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>,
and carefully examined by him as well as by my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>
and myself. As is usually the case when in a low and flat district, this
was placed about a hundred yards from a pond, on the ground, upon a
broom-sedge ridge, about two feet above the level of the surrounding
salt marsh. It was made of dry grass, and measured between seven
and eight inches in its internal diameter, with a depth of two inches
and a half, while its external diameter was twelve inches. The grass
was pretty regularly and compactly disposed, especially in the interior,
on which much care seemed to have been bestowed. No feathers or
other materials had been used in its construction, not even a twig.
The eggs were four, smooth, considerably rounded, or broadly elliptical,
bluish-white, an inch and three-quarters in length, an inch and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' href='#Page_400'>400</a></span>
quarter in breadth. The two birds were procured, and their measurements
carefully entered in my journal, as well as those of others obtained
in various parts of the United States and of the British Provinces.
A nest found on the Alleghanies was placed under a low bush,
in an open spot of scarcely half an acre. It was constructed in the
same manner, as the one described above, but was more bulky, the bed
being about four inches from the earth. The eggs, although of the
same form and colour, were slightly sprinkled with small marks of pale
reddish-brown. In general, the Marsh Hawks scoop the ground, for
the purpose of fixing their nest to the spot. On returning to London,
in the summer of 1837, I shewed several of the eggs of the American
bird to <span class="smcap">William Yarbell</span>, Esq. who at once pronounced them to belong
to the Hen Harrier; and on comparing their measurements with
those of the eggs described by my friend <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span>, I
find that they agree perfectly.
</p>

<p>
The young are at first covered with soft yellowish-white down, but
in a few weeks shew the brownish and ferruginous tints of their female
parent, the young males being distinguishable from the females by
their smaller size.
</p>

<p>
I have found a greater number of barren females in this species
than in any other; and to this I in part attribute their predominance
over the males. The food of the Marsh Hawk consists of insects of
various kinds, especially crickets, of small lizards, frogs, snakes, birds,
principally the smaller sorts, although it will attack Partridges, Plovers,
and even Green-winged Teals, when urged by excessive hunger.
The only instance in which I have seen this bird carry any prey in its
talons on wing, happened on the 2d of April 1837, at the south-west
Pass of the Mississippi, when I was in company with <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>,
Esq. and my son <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>. A Marsh Hawk was seen to seize
a bird on its nest, perhaps a Marsh Wren, <i>Troglodytes palustris</i>, and
carry it off in its talons with the nest! A pair were hovering over the
marsh during the whole of our stay, and probably had a nest thereabout.
It is rather a cowardly bird, however, for on several occasions,
when I was in the Floridas, where it is abundant, I saw it chase a
Salt-water Marsh Hen, <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, which courageously sprung up,
and striking at its enemy, forced it off. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> has
frequently observed similar occurrence in the neighbourhood of Charleston.
Whenever it seizes a bird on wing, it almost at once drops to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' href='#Page_401'>401</a></span>
the ground with it, and if in an exposed place, hops off with its prey
to the nearest concealment.
</p>

<p>
In autumn, after the young have left their parents, they hunt in
packs. This I observed on several occasions when on my way back from
Labrador. In Nova Scotia, on the 27th of August, we procured nearly
a whole pack, by concealing ourselves, but did not see an adult male.
These birds are fond of searching for prey over the same fields, removing
from one plantation to another, and returning with a remarkable
degree of regularity, and this apparently for a whole season, if not a
longer period. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> observed a beautiful old
male which had one of its primaries cut short by a shot, regularly return
to the same rice-field during the whole of the autumn and winter,
and believes that the same individual revisits the same spot annually.
When satiated with food, the Marsh Hawk may be seen perched on a
fence-stake for more than an hour, standing motionless. On horseback
I have approached them on such occasions near enough to see the colour
of their eyes, before they would reluctantly open their wings, and
remove to another stake not far distant, where they would probably remain
until digestion was accomplished.
</p>

<p>
I have never seen this species searching for food in the dusk. Indeed,
in our latitudes, when the orb of day has withdrawn from our
sight, the twilight is so short, and the necessity of providing a place of
safety for the night so imperious in birds that are not altogether nocturnal,
that I doubt whether the Marsh Hawk, which has perhaps been on
wing the greater part of the day, and has had many opportunities of procuring
food, would continue its flight for the sake of the scanty fare
which it might perchance procure at a time when few birds are abroad,
and when quadrupeds only are awakening from their daily slumber.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> must have been misinformed by some one unacquainted
with the arrival and departure of this species, as well as of the Rice
Bird, in South Carolina, when he was induced to say that the Marsh
Hawk “is particularly serviceable to the rice-fields of the Southern
States, by the havoc it makes among the clouds of Rice Buntings that
spread such devastation among the grain, in its early stages. As it
sails low, and swiftly, over the surface of the field, it keeps the flocks
in perpetual fluctuation, and greatly interrupts their depredations. The
planters consider one Marsh Hawk to be equal to several Negroes for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
alarming the Rice Birds.” Now, good Reader, my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>,
who has resided more than twenty years in South Carolina, and
who is a constant student of nature, and perhaps more especially attentive
to the habits of birds, informs me that the Marsh Hawk is proportionally
rare in that State, and that it only makes its appearance there
<i>after</i> the Rice Birds have left the country for the south, and retires at
the approach of spring, <i>before</i> they have arrived.
</p>

<p>
European writers have generally considered our Marsh Hawk as
larger than their <i>Circus cyaneus</i>; but this opinion must have originated
from a want of specimens for comparison, and perhaps also a want of
books on which one might depend. Were all ornithological works
characterized by the accuracy and detail to be found in those of my
friend <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span>, the case might be different.  The
measurements which he has taken from recent specimens correspond
with those which I also have taken from individuals newly killed, as
nearly as is usual in birds of other species. Indeed, should you measure
as accurately as possible a hundred specimens of any bird as large
as our Marsh Hawk, I am persuaded you would not find many of them
to agree in all their proportions. Instead of the American exceeding
the European bird in size, I think it will generally be found to be
as nearly equal as possible.

Adult Female. Plate CCCLVI. Fig. 2.
</p>

<p>
The female is larger than the male, and differs extremely in the
colours of the plumage, although those of the bare parts are the same.
The general colour of the upper parts is umber-brown, of the lower
light yellowish-red. The upper part of the head is deep brown, the
feathers edged with light yellowish-red; the anterior part of the forehead,
a band over the eye, and the loral space, pale greyish-yellow,
the bristle-tips of the latter black.  The cheek feathers are dull
brown, slightly edged with yellowish-red; the ruff feathers light yellowish-red,
with a narrow brown central band. The upper hind part,
sides, and fore part of the neck, the breast and sides, are light reddish-yellow,
each feather with an oblong-lanceolate umber-brown mark.
Some of the hypochondrial feathers have four light spots; the central
part of the outer tibial feathers is light brownish-red; the feathers of
the middle of the breast, the abdomen, and the lower tail-coverts, are
of a uniform light yellowish-red. On some of the scapulars, as well as
many of the wing-coverts, are one or two round light red or whitish
spots; and the bases of the occipital feathers are white. The primary
and secondary quills are of the same colour as the back, slightly edged
with paler, the greater part of the inner webs whitish, the primaries
with broad bands of deeper brown. Upper tail-coverts white. Tail
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>
light greyish-brown, white at the base, with six broad bands of deep
brown on the middle feathers, four on the lateral, the last band much
larger, the tips brownish or reddish white, the inner webs, excepting
the two middle feathers, reddish-grey or whitish, the shafts light
brown. Lower wing-coverts reddish-white, with central lanceolate
brown markings: lower surface of primary quills greyish-white, with
very conspicuous broad blackish-brown bands; tail reddish-grey beneath,
with the dark bands more distinct.

Young fully fledged. Plate CCCLVI. Fig. 3.
</p>

<p>
The young of both sexes when fully fledged, resemble the adult
female, but have the colours of a richer or deeper tint; all the lower
parts with an elongated brown streak on each feather; the upper tail-coverts
white, with a lanceolate reddish-brown spot.
</p>

<p class="p2">
After the first moult, the male still resembles the adult female.
At least, such is the case with a specimen presented to me by Dr
<span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, and marked “<i>Buteo (Circus) cyaneus</i>. Spec. N. 6.
Male. May 31. 1826. Fort Franklin,” being the one elaborately described
at p. 63 of the second volume of the <i>Fauna Boreali-Americana</i>.
In this specimen the colours are much faded, and the feathers worn, the
upper tail-coverts in particular being reduced almost to the shafts. It is
valuable as indicating by two feathers on the leg, which are new, the
next state of plumage of the male, which is as follows:—
</p>

<p>
The upper part of the head and the hind neck are light brownish-red,
with dusky streaks, the white of the nuchal feathers conspicuous.
The upper parts are brown, with a tinge of grey, more apparent on
the wings, the scapulars and some of the smaller wing-coverts still
marked as in the young and females; the upper tail-coverts pure
white; the tail-feathers grey, with a tinge of brown, the lateral reddish-grey;
the dark bars much diminished in breadth, and the inner
webs still tinged with yellowish-red. The ruff is brownish-grey, margined
with reddish-white; the fore part of the neck and breast pale
brownish-red, tinged with grey, each feather marginally spotted or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' href='#Page_406'>406</a></span>
edged with dull white. The rest of the lower parts are white, the
feathers generally with several spots of light red along the centre;
these spots assuming the appearance of transverse bars on the sides
and legs; the smaller wing coverts are similarly spotted, but those
near the edge have only a dusky streak, and the secondary coverts are
barred with dusky. The inner webs of the quills toward the base are
white, with narrow bars of brownish-black, and the extremities of the
primaries are as in the adult.
</p>

<p>
After a very careful comparison of seven skins of American birds
with an equal number of European, no essential differences can be observed.
I am therefore compelled to conclude, that the Marsh Hawk
of America is the Hen-Harrier of Europe. The following measurements
are obtained from a comparison of eight individuals.

<h2>
THE COMMON MAGPIE.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Corvus Pica</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Although Magpies are abundant in the north-western portions of
the United States, and are met with as far north as the Saskatchewan
River, where, according to Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, some of them spend the
winter, none have yet been seen nearer the shores of the Atlantic than
the head waters of the Red River in Louisiana, where they were seen
in abundance by the lamented Colonel <span class="smcap">Pike</span>, then a lieutenant in the
United States’ army. His notice, although already published by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>,
so well describes the habits of this species, that I repeat it here
with pleasure. “Our horses,” he says, “were obliged to scrape the
snow away to obtain their miserable pittance; and, to increase their
misfortune, the poor animals were attacked by the Magpies, who, attracted
by the scent of their sore backs, alighted on them, and, in defiance
of their wincing and kicking, picked many places quite raw; the
difficulty of procuring food rendering those birds so bold as to alight
on our men’s arms, and eat meat out of their hands.” To <span class="smcap">Clarke</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lewis</span>, however, is due the first introduction of this bird into the
Fauna of the United States. These intrepid travellers first observed
the Magpie near the great bend of the Missouri, although it was known
to have been obtained at the fur-trading factories of the Hudson’s Bay
Company.
</p>

<p>
There is a difference of opinion as to the identity of the Magpie of
America and that of Europe. <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, who has seen those
of both countries, as well as their nests, and observed their habits, assures
me, that he looks upon them as clearly of the same species. Captain
<span class="smcap">Sabine</span> thought differently, and <span class="smcap">Charles Bonaparte</span>, after remarking
in his “Observations on the Nomenclature of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>,” that
“it is not a little singular that this species, which is so common in
every part of Europe, should be confined in its range on this continent
to the western and northern regions,” thus plainly indicating his belief
of their identity, names it, in a list of European and North American
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
Birds, published in London in April 1838, “<i>Pica Hudsonica</i>. Nob.”
the European bird being at the same time ticketed “<i>Pica melanoleuca</i>.”
Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>, in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, remarks on comparing
them:—“We cannot perceive the slightest difference whereon to
build even the character of a variety, much less a species;” and this
truly is my own opinion.
</p>

<p>
The following notice regarding our bird was given me by my friend
<span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>:—“On the 15th of July, arriving at the borders of
the Shoshonee, or Snake River, we first met with the Common Magpie on
our route, mostly accompanied by the Raven, but there were no Crows.
The young birds were so familiar and greedy, approaching the encampment
in quest of food, as to be easily taken by the Indian boys, when
they soon become reconciled to savage domesticity. The old birds
were sufficiently shy, but the young were observed hopping and croaking
around us, and tugging at any offal of flesh meat thrown out, like
so many vultures. Differing so far from the proscribed and persecuted
Magpies of Europe, these, at least the young, seemed evidently to
court the advantages of society in supplying them with food, and betrayed
scarcely any alarm on our approach. If chased off for an instant,
they returned the next, and their monotonous and gluttonous croak
was heard around us at all hours of the day. The dryness of the season,
and the scarcity of insects and small birds, urged them no doubt
to this unusual familiarity with their doubtful friend and frequent
enemy, man. By the borders of streams in the central table-land of
the Rocky Mountains, in several places we saw the old nests of the
Magpie, made usually in low but thick bushes in the usual manner,
barricaded over and floored with interlaced twigs. We scarcely ever
saw them at all in the heavy forests of the Lower Columbia, any more
than the Platte and Missouri, in all which places they are merely accidental
visitors. They are not uncommon, however, in the vicinity
of Monterey in Upper California. Their common call is <i>pay pay</i>, and
the usual low social chatter when approaching their companions. I
one day observed a small flock, and among the fraternity heard one
chattering familiarly in the varied tune of the Cat-bird, as he sat on
a bough by the water, where birds might become his prey. At another
time I observed a flock of young Magpies boldly persecuting other
birds, and chasing even Pigeon Hawks.”
</p>

<p>
The following characteristic account of the habits of the Magpie as
observed in Scotland, I have extracted from my friend <span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>’s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
“History of British Birds.” “It is generally distributed in Britain,
being more or less common in all the cultivated and wooded districts
of England and Scotland, both in the interior and along the coast, although
nowhere numerous, on account of the hostility of gamekeepers,
gardeners, and sportsmen of all degrees. There, on the old ash that
overshadows the farm-yard, you may see a pair, one perched on the
topmost twig, the other hopping among the branches, uttering an incessant
clatter of short hard notes, scarcely resembling any thing else
in nature, but withal not unpleasant, at least to the lover of birds.
How gracefully she of the top twig swings in the breeze! Off she starts,
and directing her flight towards the fir wood opposite, proceeds with a
steady, moderately rapid, but rather heavy flight, performed by quick
beats of her apparently short wings, intermitted for a moment at intervals.
Chattering by the way, she seems to call her mate after her;
but he, intent on something which he has spied, hops downwards from
twig to branch, and descends to the ground. Raising his body as high
as possible, and carrying his tail inclined upwards, to avoid contact
with the moist grass, he walks a few paces, and spying an earthworm
half protruded from its hole, drags it out by a sudden jerk, breaks it
in pieces, and swallows it. Now, under the hedge he has found a
snail, which he will presently detach from its shell. But something
among the bushes has startled him, and lightly he springs upwards,
chattering the while, to regain his favourite tree. It is a cat, which,
not less frightened than himself, runs off toward the house. The Magpie
again descends, steps slowly over the green, looking from side to
side, stops and listens, advances rapidly by a succession of leaps, and
encounters a whole brood of chickens, with their mother at their heels.
Were they unprotected, how deliciously would the Magpie feast, but alas,
it is vain to think of it, for with fury in her eye, bristled plumage, and
loud clamour, headlong rushes the hen, overturning two of her younglings,
when the enemy suddenly wheels round, avoiding the encounter,
and flies off after his mate.
</p>

<p>
There again, you perceive them in the meadow, as they walk about,
with elevated tails, looking for something eatable, although apparently
with little success. By the hedge afar off are two boys with a gun,
endeavouring to creep up to a flock of plovers on the other side. But
the Magpies have observed them, and presently rising fly directly over
the field, chattering vehemently, on which the whole flock takes to
wing, and the disappointed sportsmen sheer off in another direction.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The food of the Magpie consists of testaceous mollusca, slugs, larvæ,
worms, young birds, eggs, small quadrupeds, carrion, sometimes
grain and fruits of different kinds, in search of which it frequents the
fields, hedges, thickets, and orchards, occasionally visits the farm-yard,
prowls among the stacks, perches on the house-top, whence it sallies at
times, and examines the dunghill and places around. Although it
searches for larvæ and worms in the ploughed fields, it never ventures,
like the Rook, and several species of Gull, to follow the plough as it
turns over each successive furrow. It has been accused of picking the
eyes of lambs and sickly sheep, I think with injustice; but it sometimes
carries off a chicken or duckling, and sucks an egg that may have been
dropt abroad.
</p>

<p>
It is extremely shy and vigilant in the vicinity of towns, where it is
much molested, but less so in country places, although even there it is
readily alarmed. When one pursues it openly, it flits along the walls
and hedges, shifts from tree to tree, and at length flies off to a distance.
Yet it requires all its vigilance to preserve its life; for, as it
destroys the eggs and young of game birds, it is keenly pursued by
keepers and sportsmen, so that one might marvel to find it maintaining
its ground as a species, and yet it is not apparently diminishing in most
parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
On the ground it generally walks in the same manner as the Crows,
but occasionally leaps in a sidelong direction. The sounds which it
emits are a sort of chuckling cry or chatter, which it utters when
alarmed, as well as when it wishes to apprize other birds of danger. On
the appearance of a fox, a cat, or other unfriendly animal, it never
ceases hovering about it, and alarming the neighbourhood by its cries,
until the enemy has slunk away out of sight.
</p>

<p>
It generally keeps in pairs all the year round, accompanies its young
for some weeks after they first come abroad, and after the breeding
season retires at night to the copses or woods, where sometimes a considerable
number meet together. It begins to construct its nest early
in March, selecting as its site the top of some tall tree, a poplar, an
ash, an elm, sometimes a willow, or a beech; or, in defect of such in a
favourite locality, placing it in a thick bush of hawthorn, holly, or
other low tree, or even in a hedge. It is a large, and therefore generally
very conspicuous fabric, of a spheroidal or elliptical form, composed first
of a layer of twigs, on which is laid a quantity of mud; then a dome
of twigs, frequently hawthorn or sloe, but as often of any other kind,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>412</a></span>
loosely but securely interlaced; while the bottom of the interior is
lined with fibrous roots; and there is left in the side an aperture not
much larger than is barely sufficient to admit the bird. The eggs are
from three to six, and differ considerably in form and colouring. In general,
they are regularly ovate, or a little pointed, about an inch and
five-twelfths long, eleven and a half twelfths or an inch across; but
sometimes more elongated by one-twelfth of an inch, or abbreviated by
nearly the same quantity. Frequently they are pale green freckled all
over with umber-brown and light purple, and sometimes pale blue or
bluish-white, or greenish-white, with smaller spots and dots of the
same dark colours, so as very nearly to resemble the eggs of the Jay,
which however are smaller.

<h2>
PINE GROSBEAK.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Pyrrhula Enucleator</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLVIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
In <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s time, this beautiful bird was rare in Pennsylvania;
but since then it has occasionally been seen in considerable numbers,
and in the winter of 1836 my young friend <span class="smcap">J. Trudeau</span>, M. D. procured
several in the vicinity of Philadelphia. That season also they
were abundant in the States of New York and Massachusetts. Some
have been procured near the mouth of the Big Guyandotte on the Ohio;
and Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> has observed it on the lower parts of the Missouri.
I have ascertained it to be a constant resident in the State of Maine,
and have met with it on several islands in the Bay of Fundy, as well
as in Newfoundland and Labrador. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> mentions it as
having been observed by the Expedition in the 50th parallel, and as a
constant resident at Hudson’s Bay. It is indeed the hardiest bird of
its tribe yet discovered in North America, where even the Rose-breasted
Grosbeak, though found during summer in Newfoundland and Labrador,
removes in autumn to countries farther south than the Texas,
where as late as the middle of May I saw many in their richest plumage.
</p>

<p>
The Pine Grosbeak is a charming songster. Well do I remember
how delighted I felt, while lying on the moss-clad rocks of Newfoundland,
near St George’s Bay, I listened to its continuous lay, so late as
the middle of August, particularly about sunset. I was reminded of
the pleasure I had formerly enjoyed on the banks of the clear Mohawk,
under nearly similar circumstances, when lending an attentive ear to
the mellow notes of another Grosbeak. But, Reader, at Newfoundland
I was still farther removed from my beloved family; the scenery
around was thrice wilder and more magnificent. The stupendous dark
granite rocks, fronting the north, as if bidding defiance to the wintry
tempests, brought a chillness to my heart, as I thought of the hardships
endured by those intrepid travellers who, for the advancement of
science, had braved the horrors of the polar winter. The glowing tints
of the western sky, and the brightening stars twinkling over the waters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
of the great Gulf, rivetted me to the spot, and the longer I gazed, the
more I wished to remain; but darkness was suddenly produced by the
advance of a mass of damp fog, the bird ceased its song, and all around
seemed transformed into chaos. Silently I groped my way to the beach,
and soon reached the Ripley.
</p>

<p>
The young gentlemen of my party, accompanied by my son <span class="smcap">John
Woodhouse</span>, and a Newfoundland Indian, had gone into the interior in
search of Rein Deer, but returned the following afternoon, having found
the flies and musquitoes intolerable. My son brought a number of Pine
Grosbeaks, of different sexes, young and adult, but all the latter in
moult, and patched with dark red, ash, black and white. It was curious
to see how covered with sores the legs of the old birds of both sexes
were. These sores or excrescences are, I believe, produced by the
resinous matter of the fir-trees on which they obtain their food. Some
specimens had the hinder part of the tarsi more than double the usual
size, the excrescences could not be removed by the hand, and I was
surprised that the birds had not found means of ridding themselves of
such an inconvenience. One of the figures in my plate represents the
form of these sores.
</p>

<p>
I was assured that during mild winters, the Pine Grosbeak is found
in the forests of Newfoundland in considerable numbers, and that some
remain during the most severe cold. A lady who had resided there many
years, and who was fond of birds, assured me that she had kept several
males in cages; that they soon became familiar, would sing during the
night, and fed on all sorts of fruits and berries during the summer,
and on seeds of various kinds in winter; that they were fond of bathing,
but liable to cramps; and that they died of sores produced around
their eyes and the base of the upper mandible. I have observed the
same to happen to the Cardinal and Rose-breasted Grosbeaks.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this bird is undulating and smooth, performed in a direct
line when it is migrating, at a considerable height above the forests,
and in groups of from five to ten individuals. They alight frequently
during the day, on such trees as are opening their buds or blossoms.
At such times they are extremely gentle, and easily approached, are
extremely fond of bathing, and whether on the ground or on branches,
move by short leaps. I have been much surprised to see, on my having
fired, those that were untouched, fly directly towards me, until within
a few feet, and then slide off and alight on the lower branches of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
the nearest tree, where, standing as erect as little Hawks, they
gazed upon me as if I were an object quite new, and of whose nature
they were ignorant. They are easily caught under snow-shoes put up
with a figure of four, around the wood-cutters camps, in the State of
Maine, and are said to afford good eating. Their food consists of the
buds and seeds of almost all sorts of trees. Occasionally also they
seize a passing insect. I once knew one of these sweet songsters,
which, in the evening, as soon as the lamp was lighted in the room
where its cage was hung, would instantly tune its voice anew.
</p>

<p>
My kind friend <span class="smcap">Thomas M’Culloch</span> of Pictou in Nova Scotia, has
sent me the following notice, which I trust will prove as interesting to
you as it has been to me. “Last winter the snow was exceedingly
deep, and the storms so frequent and violent that many birds must
have perished in consequence of the scarcity of food. The Pine Grosbeaks
being driven from the woods, collected about the barns in great
numbers, and even in the streets of Pictou they frequently alighted in
search of food. A pair of these birds which had been recently taken
were brought me by a friend, but they were in such a poor emaciated
condition, that I almost despaired of being able to preserve them alive.
Being anxious, however, to note for you the changes of their plumage,
I determined to make the attempt; but notwithstanding all my care,
they died a few days after they came into my possession. Shortly after,
I received a male in splendid plumage, but so emaciated that he
seemed little else than a mass of feathers. By more cautious feeding,
however, he soon regained his flesh, and became so tame as to eat from
my hand without the least appearance of fear. To reconcile him gradually
to confinement, he was permitted to fly about my bedroom, and
upon rising in the morning, the first thing I did was to give him a small
quantity of seed. But three mornings in succession I happened to lie
rather later than usual, and each morning I was aroused by the bird
fluttering upon my shoulder, and calling for his usual allowance. The
third morning, I allowed him to flutter about me some time before
shewing any symptom of being awake, but he no sooner observed that
his object was effected than he retired to the window and waited patiently
until I arose. As the spring approached, he used to whistle
occasionally in the morning, and his notes, like those of his relative the
Rose-breasted Grosbeak, were exceedingly rich and full. About the
time, however, when the species began to remove to the north, his former
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
familiarity entirely disappeared. During the day he never rested
a moment, but continued to run from one side of the window to the
other, seeking a way of escape, and frequently during the night, when
the moonlight would fall upon the window, I was awakened by him
dashing against the glass. The desire of liberty seemed at last to absorb
every other feeling, and during four days I could not detect the
least diminution in the quantity of his food, while at the same time he
filled the house with a piteous wailing cry, which no person could hear
without feeling for the poor captive. Unable to resist his appeals, I
gave him his release; but when this was attained he seemed very careless
of availing himself of it. Having perched upon the top of a tree
in front of the house, he arranged his feathers, and looked about him
for a short time. He then alighted by the door, and I was at last obliged
to drive him away, lest some accident should befall him.
</p>

<p>
“These birds are subject to a curious disease, which I have never
seen in any other. Irregularly shaped whitish masses are formed upon
the legs and feet. To the eye these lumps appear not unlike pieces of
lime; but when broken, the interior presents a congeries of minute
cells, as regularly and beautifully formed as those of a honey-comb.
Sometimes, though rarely, I have seen the whole of the legs and feet
covered with this substance, and when the crust was broken, the bone
was bare, and the sinews seemed almost altogether to have lost the
power of moving the feet. An acquaintance of mine kept one of these
birds during the summer months. It became quite tame, but at last
it lost the power of its legs and died. By this person I was informed
that his Grosbeak usually sang during a thunder-storm, or when rain
was falling on the house.”
</p>

<p>
While in the State of Maine, I observed that these birds, when travelling,
fly in silence, and at a considerable height above the trees.
They alight on the topmost branches, so that it is difficult to obtain
them, unless one has a remarkably good gun. But, on waiting a few
minutes, you see the flock, usually composed of seven or eight individuals,
descend from branch to branch, and betake themselves to the
ground, where they pick up gravel, hop towards the nearest pool or
streamlet, and bathe by dipping their heads and scattering the water
over them, until they are quite wet; after which they fly to the branches
of low bushes, shake themselves with so much vigour as to produce a
smart rustling sound, and arrange their plumage. They then search
for food among the boughs of the taller trees.

<p>
An adult male from Boston examined. The roof of the mouth is
moderately concave, its anterior horny part with five prominent ridges;
the lower mandible deeply concave. Tongue <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths long, firm,
deflected at the middle, deeper than broad, papillate at the base, with
a median groove; for the distal half of its length, it is cased with a
firm horny substance, and is then of an oblong shape, when viewed
from above, deeply concave, with two flattened prominences at the
base, the point rounded and thin, the back or lower surface convex.
This remarkable structure of the tongue appears to be intended for the
purpose of enabling the bird, when it has insinuated its bill between
the scales of a strobilus, to lay hold of the seed by pressing it against
the roof of the mandible. In the Crossbills, the tongue is nearly of the
same form, but more slender, and these birds feed in the same manner,
in so far as regards the prehension of the food. In the present species,
the tongue is much strengthened by the peculiar form of the basi-hyoid
bone, to which there is appended as it were above a thin longitudinal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' href='#Page_420'>420</a></span>
crest, giving it great firmness in the perpendicular movements of the
organ. The œsophagus <i>a b c d</i>, Fig. 1. is two inches 11 twelfths long,
dilated on the middle of the neck so as to form a kind of elongated
dimidiate crop, 4 twelfths of an inch in diameter, projecting to the
right side, and with the trachea passing along that side of the vertebræ.
The proventriculus <i>c</i>, is 8 twelfths long, somewhat bulbiform,
with numerous oblong glandules, its greatest diameter <span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths. A
very curious peculiarity of the stomach <i>e</i>, is, that in place of having its
axis continuous with that of the œsophagus or proventriculus, it bends
to the right nearly at a right angle. It is a very powerful gizzard, <span class="mixfract">8&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
twelfths long, 8 twelfths broad, with its lateral muscles <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span> inch thick,
the lower very distinct, the epithelium longitudinally rugous, of a light
reddish colour. The duodenum, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, first curves backward to the
length of <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch, then folds in the usual manner, passing behind the
right lobe of the liver; the intestine then passes upwards and to the
left, curves along the left side, crosses to the right, forms about ten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' href='#Page_421'>421</a></span>
circumvolutions, and above the stomach terminates in the rectum,
which is 11 twelfths long. The cœca are <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> twelfth in length and
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span> twelfth in diameter. The entire length of the intestine from the
pylorus to the anus is <span class="mixfract">31&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches (in another male 31); its greatest
breadth in the duodenum <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths, gradually contracting to <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>
twelfth. Fig. 2. represents the convoluted appearance of the intestine.
The œsophagus <i>a b c</i>; the gizzard <i>d</i>, turned forwards; the duodenum,
<i>e f</i>; the rest of the intestine, <i>g h</i> the cœca, <i>i</i>; the rectum, <i>i j</i>,
which is much dilated at the end.
</p>

<p>
The trachea is 2 inches 2 twelfths long, of uniform diameter. <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
twelfth broad, with about 60 rings; its muscles like those of all the
other species of the Passerinæ or Fringillidæ.
</p>

<p>
In a female, the œsophagus is 2 inches 10 twelfths long; the intestine
31 inches long.
</p>

<p>
In all these individuals and several others, the stomach contained
a great quantity of particles of white quartz, with remains of seeds;
and in the œsophagus of one was an oat seed entire.
</p>

<p>
Although this bird is in its habits very similar to the Crossbills,
and feeds on the same sort of food, it differs from them in the form
and extent of its crop, in having the gizzard much larger, and the intestines
more than double the length, in proportion to the size of the
bird.

<p>
This species extends its range from the mouth of the Columbia
River, across our continent, to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico; but
how far north it may proceed is as yet unknown. On the 10th of
April 1837, whilst on Cayo Island, in the Bay of Mexico, I found a
specimen of this bird dead at the door of a deserted house, which had
recently been occupied by some salt-makers. From its freshness I supposed
that it had sought refuge in the house on the preceding evening,
which had been very cold for the season.  Birds of several other species
we also found dead on the beaches. The individual thus met with
was emaciated, probably in consequence of a long journey and scanty
fare; but I was not the less pleased with it, as it afforded me the means
of taking measurements of a species not previously described in full.
In my possession are some remarkably fine skins, from Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>’s
collection, which differ considerably from the figure given by <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>,
who first described the species. So nearly allied is it to the
Green-crested Flycatcher, <i>M. crinita</i>, that after finding the dead bird,
my son and I, seeing many individuals of that species on the trees
about the house mentioned, shot several of them, supposing them, to be
the same. We are indebted to the lamented <span class="smcap">Thomas Say</span> for the introduction
of the Arkansaw Flycatcher into our Fauna. Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>
has supplied me with an account of its manners.
</p>

<p>
“We first met with this bold and querulous species, early in July,
in the scanty woods which border the north-west branch of the Platte,
within the range of the Rocky Mountains; and from thence we saw
them to the forests of the Columbia and the Wahlamet, as well as in
all parts of Upper California, to latitude 32°. They are remarkably
noisy and quarrelsome with each other, and in the time of incubation,
like the King Bird, suffer nothing of the bird kind to approach them
without exhibiting their predilection for battle and dispute. About
the middle of June, in the dark swamped forests of the Wahlamet, we
every day heard the discordant clicking warble of this bird, somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_423' href='#Page_423'>423</a></span>
like <i>tsh’k</i>, <i>tsh’k</i>, <i>tshivait</i>, sounding almost like the creaking of a rusty
door-hinge, somewhat in the manner of the King Bird, with a blending
of the notes of the Blackbird or Common Grakle. Although I saw
these birds residing in the woods of the Columbia, and near the St
Diego in Upper California, I have not been able to find the nest, which
is probably made in low thickets, where it would be consequently easily
overlooked. In the Rocky Mountains they do not probably breed before
midsummer, as they are still together in noisy quarrelsome bands
until the middle of June.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>’s notice respecting it is as follows: “This is the
<i>Chlow-ish-pil</i> of the Chinooks. It is numerous along the banks of the
Platte, particularly in the vicinity of trees and bushes. It is found
also, though not so abundantly, across the whole range of the Rocky
Mountains; and among the banks of the Columbia to the ocean, it is a
very common species. Its voice is much more musical than is usual
with birds of its genus, and its motions are remarkably quick and
graceful. Its flight is often long sustained, and like the Common
King Bird, with which it associates, it is frequently seen to rest in the
air, maintaining its position for a considerable time. The males are
wonderfully belligerent, fighting almost constantly, and with great
fury, and their loud notes of anger and defiance remind one strongly of
the discordant grating and creaking of a rusty door hinge. The
Indians of the Columbia accuse him of a propensity to destroy the
young, and eat the eggs of other birds.”

<p>
Not having seen this handsome bird alive, I am unable to give you
any account of its habits from my own observation; but I have pleasure
in supplying the deficiency by extracting the following notice from
the “Manual of the Ornithology of the United States and of Canada,”
by my excellent friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>.
</p>

<p>
“This very beautiful and singular species of Flycatcher is confined
wholly to the open plains and scanty forests of the remote south-western
regions beyond the Mississippi, where they, in all probability, extend
their residence to the high plains of Mexico. I found these birds rather
common near the banks of Red River, about the confluence of the
Kiamesha. I again saw them more abundant, near the Great Salt
River of the Arkansa in the month of August, when the young and old
appeared, like our King Birds, assembling together previously to their
departure for the south. They alighted repeatedly on the tall plants
of the prairie, and were probably preying upon the grasshoppers, which
were now abundant. At this time also, they were wholly silent, and
flitted before our path with suspicion and timidity. A week or two
after, we saw them no more, having retired probably to tropical winter-quarters.
</p>

<p>
“In the month of May, a pair, which I daily saw for three or four
weeks, had made a nest on the horizontal branch of an elm, probably
twelve or more feet from the ground. I did not examine it very near,
but it appeared externally composed of coarse dry grass. The female,
when first seen, was engaged in sitting, and her mate wildly attacked
every bird which approached their residence. The harsh chirping
note of the male, kept up at intervals, as remarked by Mr <span class="smcap">Say</span>, almost
resembled the barking of the Prairie Marmot, <i>’tsh</i>, <i>’tsh</i>, <i>’tsh</i>. His flowing
kite-like tail, spread or contracted at will while flying, is a singular
trait in his plumage, and rendered him conspicuously beautiful to
the most careless observer.”

<p>
This species was first discovered by <span class="smcap">Titian Peale</span>, Esq. of Philadelphia,
and named after Mr <span class="smcap">Thomas Say</span> by <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>, who described
and figured it in his continuation of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s American Ornithology.
It appears to range over a very extensive portion of country,
lying between Mexico and the settlements of the British Fur Companies,
a pair having been procured at Carlton House, as mentioned by
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>. Little is yet known of the habits of this species, but
it would seem, from Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s remarks, to be a rupestrine Flycatcher,
and not strictly arboreal, as supposed by Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>.
</p>

<p>
“We first observed this bird,” says Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, “in our route
westward, about the 14th of June, within the first range of the Rocky
Mountains called the Black Hills, and in the vicinity of that northern
branch of the Platte known by the name of Larimie’s Fork. At the
time, we saw a pair perched as usual on masses of rocks, from which,
like the Pewee, though occasionally alighted, they flew after passing
insects, without uttering any note that we heard; and from their predilection,
it is probable they inhabit among broken hills and barren
rocks, where we have scarcely a doubt, from their behaviour, they
had at this time a brood in a nest among these granite cliffs. They
appeared very timorous on our approach, and seemed very limited in
their range. Except among the Blue Mountains of the Columbia,
we scarcely ever saw them again. Their manners appear to be very
much like those of the Common Pewee; but they are much more silent
and shy.”

<h2>
WINTER WREN.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Troglodytes hyemalis</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLX. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
The extent of the migratory movements of this diminutive bird, is
certainly the most remarkable fact connected with its history. At the
approach of winter it leaves its northern retreats, perhaps in Labrador
or Newfoundland, crosses the inlets of the Gulf of St Lawrence on
tiny concave wings, and betakes itself to warmer regions, where it remains
until the beginning of spring. Playfully and with alacrity it
performs the task, hopping from one stump or fallen log to another,
flitting from twig to twig, from bush to bush, here and there flying a
few yards; feeding, singing, and bustling on, as if quite careless as to
time or distance. It has reached the shore of some broad stream, and
here a person ignorant of its habits might suppose it would be stopped;
but no, it spreads its wings, and glides over like a meteor.
</p>

<p>
I have found the Winter Wren in the lower parts of Louisiana,
and in the Floridas, in December and January, but never saw one
there after the end of the latter month. Their stay in those parts
rarely exceeds three months; two more are employed in forming a
nest and rearing their broods; and as they leave Labrador by the middle
of August at the latest, they probably spend more than half of the
year in travelling. It would be interesting to know whether those
which breed along the Columbia River, near the Pacific Ocean, visit
the shores of our Atlantic States. My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> informs
me that he occasionally saw the Winter Wren feeding its young
in the woods, along the north-west coast.
</p>

<p>
At Eastport, in Maine, when on my way to Labrador, I found
this species in full song, and extremely abundant, although the air
was chill, and icicles hung from every rock, it being then the 9th of
May. On the 11th of June, I found it equally plentiful in the Magdalene
Islands, and wondered how it could have made its way there, but
was assured by the inhabitants that none were ever seen in winter.
On the 20th of July, I met with it at Labrador, and again asked myself,
how it could possibly have reached those remote and rugged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_431' href='#Page_431'>431</a></span>
shores? Was it by following the course of the St Lawrence, or by
flying from one island to another across the Gulf? I have seen it in
almost every State of the Union, but only twice found it breeding
there, once near the Mohawk River in New York, and again in the
Great Pine Swamp in Pennsylvania. It breeds abundantly in Maine,
and probably in Massachusetts, but few spend the winter even in the
latter State.
</p>

<p>
The song of the Winter Wren excels that of any other bird of its
size with which I am acquainted. It is truly musical, lull of cadence,
energetic, and melodious; its very continuance is surprising, and dull
indeed must be the ear that thrills not on hearing it. When emitted,
as it often is, from the dark depths of the unwholesome swamp, it
operates so powerfully on the mind, that it by contrast inspires a feeling
of wonder and delight, and on such occasions has usually impressed
me with a sense of the goodness of the Almighty Creator, who has
rendered every spot of earth in some way subservient to the welfare
if his creatures.
</p>

<p>
Once when travelling through a portion of the most gloomy part
of a thick and tangled wood, in the Great Pine Forest, not far from
Maunchunk in Pennsylvania, at a time when I was intent on guarding
myself against the venomous reptiles which I expected to encounter,
the sweet song of this Wren came suddenly on my ear, and with so
cheering an effect, that I instantly lost all apprehension of danger,
and pressed forward through the rank briars and stiff laurels, in pursuit
of the bird, which I hoped was not far from its nest. But he, as if
bent on puzzling me, rambled here and there among the thickest
bushes with uncommon cunning, now singing in one spot not far distant,
and presently in another in a different direction. After much
exertion and considerable fatigue, I at last saw it alight on the side of
a large tree, close to the roots, and heard it warble a few notes, which
I thought exceeded any it had previously uttered. Suddenly another
Wren appeared by its side, but darted off in a moment, and the bird
itself which I had followed disappeared. I soon reached the spot,
without having for an instant removed my eyes from it, and observed
a protuberance covered with moss and lichens, resembling those excrescences
which are often seen on our forest trees, with this difference,
that the aperture was perfectly rounded, clean, and quite smooth. I
put a finger into it, and felt the pecking of a bird’s bill, while a querulous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_432' href='#Page_432'>432</a></span>
cry was emitted. In a word, I had, the first time in my life,
found the nest of our Winter Wren. Having gently forced the tenant
from his premises, I drew out the eggs with a sort of scoop which I
formed. I expected to find them numerous, but there were not more
than six, and the same number I afterwards found in the only other
nest of this species ever discovered by me. The little bird called upon
its mate, and their united clamour induced me to determine upon
leaving their treasures with them; but just as I was about going off,
it struck me that I ought to take a description of the nest, as I might
not again have such an opportunity. I hope, Reader, you will believe
that when I resolved to sacrifice this nest, it was quite as much on
your account as my own. Externally it measured seven inches in
length, four and a half in breadth; the thickness of its walls, composed
of moss and lichen, was nearly two inches; and thus it presented internally
the appearance of a narrow bag, the wall, however, being reduced
to a few lines where it was in contact with the bark of the tree.
The lower half of the cavity was compactly lined with the fur of the
American Hare, and in the bottom or bed of the nest there lay over
this about half a dozen of the large downy abdominal feathers of our
Common Grous, <i>Tetrao Umbellus</i>. The eggs were of a delicate blush-colour,
somewhat resembling the paler leaves of a partially decayed
rose, and marked with dots of reddish-brown, more numerous towards
the larger end.
</p>

<p>
The nest which I found near the Mohawk was discovered by mere
accident. One day in the beginning of June, and about noon, feeling
fatigued, I sat down on a rock overhanging the water, where, while
resting, I might have the pleasure of watching the motions of some
fishes in sight. The damp of the place produced a sudden chillness,
and caused me to sneeze aloud, when from beneath my feet there flew
off a Winter Wren. The nest, which I soon found, was attached to
the lower parts of the rock, and presented the same form and structure
as that already described; but it was smaller, the eggs, six in number,
contained young far advanced.
</p>

<p>
The motions of this interesting bird are performed with great rapidity
and decision. While searching for food it hops, creeps, and
leaps about from one spot to another, as if it derived pleasure from
exercise. At each movement it bends its breast downward, so as almost
to touch the object on which it stands, and by a sudden extension
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_433' href='#Page_433'>433</a></span>
of its strong feet, aided by the action of its half drooping concave
wings, jerks itself forward, keeping its tail elevated all the while.
Now through a hollow log it passes like a mouse, now it clings to the
surface in various attitudes, suddenly disappears, but presently shews
itself by your side; at times it chirrups in a querulous rolling tone, then
emits single clear sharp chirps resembling the syllables <i>tshick</i>, <i>tshick</i>,
and again remains silent for a time. It will now and then reach the
upper branches of a small tree or a bush, by hopping and leaping
from twig to twig; in the course of this transit it will present its opposite
sides to you a score of times; and when at length it has gained
the summit, it will salute you with its delicate melody, and then dash
headlong and be out of sight in a moment. This is almost constantly
observed during the spring season, when more than ever its alertness
is displayed. On all such occasions however, whilst in the act of singing,
its tail is seen to be depressed. In winter, when it takes possession
of the wood-pile, close to the husbandman’s dwelling, it will challenge
the cat in querulous tones, and peeping out here and there, as
it frisks in security, wear out Grimalkin’s patience.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Winter Wren consists chiefly of spiders, caterpillars,
and small moths, as well as larvæ. Towards autumn it eats small
juicy berries.
</p>

<p>
Having lately spent a winter, at Charleston in South Carolina,
with my worthy friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, I observed that this little
Wren made its appearance in that city and its suburbs in December.
On the 1st January I heard it in full song in the garden of my friend,
who informed me that in that State it does not appear regularly every
winter, but is sure to be found during very cold weather.
</p>

<p>
With the view of enabling you to compare the habits of our Winter
Wren and the Common Wren of Europe, the manners of birds being a
subject on which, as you are well aware, I have always bestowed particular
attention, I here present you with those of the latter bird, as
observed in Britain, by my learned friend, <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span>:—“With
us the Wren is not migratory, but is found during winter
in the most northern parts of the island, as well as in the Hebrides.
Its flight is effected by a rapid and continuous motion of the wings, and
therefore is not undulated, but direct; nor is it usually sustained, for
the bird merely flits from one bush to another, or from stone to stone.
It is most frequently met with along stone-walls, among fragments of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_434' href='#Page_434'>434</a></span>
rocks, in thickets of gorse, and by hedges, where it attracts notice by
the liveliness of its motions, and frequently by its loud chirring noise.
When standing, it keeps its tail nearly erect, and jerks its whole body;
then hops about with alacrity, using its wings at the same time, and
continually enunciating its rapid chit. In spring and summer, the
male has a very pleasing, full, rich, and mellow song, which it repeats
at intervals; and even in autumn and on fine days in winter, it may
often be heard hurrying over its ditty, the loudness and clearness of
which, as proceeding from so diminutive a creature, is apt to excite
surprise, even after it has been long familiar.
</p>

<p>
“During the breeding season, Wrens keep in pairs, often in unfrequented
parts, such as bushy dells, mossy woods, the banks of streams,
and stony places overgrown with brambles, sloes, and other shrubs; but
they are also to be found in shrubberies, gardens, and hedges in the
immediate vicinity of human habitations, to which the wilder individuals
also approach in winter. They are not properly speaking shy,
as they conceive themselves to be secure at the distance of twenty or
thirty yards; but on the approach of a person, they conceal themselves
in holes among stones, or the roots of bushes.
</p>

<p>
“I know not a more pleasant object to look at than the Wren; it
is always so smart and cheerful. In gloomy weather, other birds often
seem melancholy, and in rain the Sparrows and Finches stand silent on
the twigs, with drooping wings and ruffled plumage. But to the Wren
all weathers are alike. The big drops of the thunder-shower no more
wet it than the drizzle of an easterly haar; and as it peeps from beneath
the bramble, or glances from a hole in the wall, it seems as snug
as a kitten frisking on the parlour rug.
</p>

<p>
“It is amusing to watch the motions of a young family of Wrens
just come abroad. Walking among furze, or broom, or juniper, you
are attracted to some bush by hearing issue from it a lively and frequent
repetition of a sound which resembles the syllable <i>chit</i>. On
going up you perceive an old Wren flitting about the twigs, and presently
a young one flies off, uttering a stiffled chirr, to conceal itself
among the bushes. Several follow in succession, while the parents
continue to flutter about, in great alarm, uttering their loud <i>chit</i>, <i>chit</i>,
<i>chit</i>, with indications of varied degrees of excitement. On open ground
a young Wren might easily be run down, and I have heard it asserted
that an old one may soon be tired out in time of snow, when it cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_435' href='#Page_435'>435</a></span>
easily conceal itself. And yet, even in such a case, it is by no means
easy to keep it in sight, for on the side of a bank, or by a wall, or in a
thicket, it will find a hole where one least expected it, and creeping in
some crevice beneath the snow, reappear at a considerable distance.
</p>

<p>
“The food of birds can be determined only by opening their crops
or stomachs, or by observation directed to living individuals, the former,
however, being the only sure method. The Wrens which I have
opened generally contained remains of insects of various kinds, with
larvæ, and sometimes pupæ; but I have also found in them seeds, and
Mr <span class="smcap">Neville Wood</span> states that they sometimes eat red currants. In
the stomach of an individual examined in December 1830, I found many
small hard seeds, an entire pupæ, and numerous fragments of the shells
of pupæ, and elytra of coleopterous insects. So small a bird having so
slender a bill, might doubtless be taken for a typical entomophagist;
but it is probable that no species of this order confines itself exclusively
to insects.
</p>

<p>
“The Wren pairs about the middle of spring, and begins early in
April to construct its nest, which varies much in form and composition,
according to the locality. One brought me by my son is of astonishing
size compared with that of its architect, its greatest diameter
being seven inches, and its height five. Having been placed on a flat
surface under a bank, its base is of a corresponding form, and is composed
of layers of decayed ferns and other plants, mixed with twigs of
herbaceous and woody vegetables. Similar materials have been employed
in raising the outer wall of the nest itself, of which the interior
is spherical, and three inches in diameter. The wall is composed
of mosses of several species, quite fresh and green, and it is arched
over with fern leaves and straws. The mosses are curiously interwoven
with fibrous roots and hair of various animals, and the inner surface is
even and compact, like coarse felt. To the height of two inches there
is a copious lining of large soft feathers, chiefly of the Wood Pigeon,
but also of the Pheasant and Domestic Duck, with a few of the Blackbird.
The aperture, which is in front, and in the form of a low arch,
two inches in breadth at the base, and an inch and a half in height,
has its lower edge formed of slender twigs, strong herbaceous stalks,
and stems of grasses, the lowest being felted in the usual manner. It
contained five eggs of an elongated oval form, averaging eight lines
in length, and six lines in breadth, pure white, with some scattered 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' href='#Page_436'>436</a></span>
dots of light red at the larger end, one of them with scarcely
any, and another with a great number. Of three nests presented
to me by my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Durham Weir</span>, Esq. one is extremely
beautiful, being composed entirely of fresh green hypna, without any
internal layer, although, no eggs having been found in it, it possibly
had not been completed. It is of an oblong form, seven inches
in length, and four in its transverse diameter.  The mouth measures
an inch and eight-twelfths across, an inch and a twelfth in
height. Its lower part is formed of small twigs of larch laid across and
interwoven, so as to present a firm pediment. The longitudinal diameter
of the interior is three inches and a half. Another, formed on
a decayed tuft of <i>Aira cæspitosa</i>, is globular, six inches in diameter, and
composed of moss, with a lining of hair and feathers, chiefly of the domestic
fowl. The third is globular, and externally formed almost entirely
of ferns, like that described above. In all the nests of this species
which I have seen, the lower part of the mouth was composed of
twigs of trees, or stems of herbaceous plants laid across, and kept together
with moss and hair.
</p>

<p>
“The nests are found in a great variety of situations: very often in
a recess overhung by a bank, sometimes in a crevice among stones, in
the hole of a wall, or of a tree, among the thatch of a cottage or outhouse,
on the top of a shed or barn, the branch of a tree, whether growing
along a wall, or standing free, among ivy, honeysuckle, clematis,
or other climbing plants. When the nest is on the ground, its base
is generally formed of leaves, twigs, and straws, and its exterior is
often similar; but when otherwise, the outer surface is generally smooth
and chiefly composed of moss.
</p>

<p>
“The number of eggs which it lays has been variously stated by authors.
Mr <span class="smcap">Weir</span> says that, although it is commonly seven or eight,
so many as sixteen or seventeen have been found in its nest. <span class="smcap">Robert
Smith</span>, weaver in Bathgate, told me, that a few years ago, he saw
in a nest, which was built on the bank of a rivulet about two miles from
Linlithgow, seventeen eggs; and <span class="smcap">James D. Baillie</span>, Esq. informed
me, that in June last, he took out of one which he discovered in a spruce
tree, near Polkemmet House, sixteen eggs.”
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas M’Culloch</span> of Pictou has presented me with
the following curious account of a European individual of this species.
</p>

<p>
“During my residence at Spring Vale in the vicinity of Hammersmith,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' href='#Page_437'>437</a></span>
I was amusing myself one afternoon with the movements of a
pair of Water-hens, which were flirting about the edge of the tall reeds
so abundant in that neighbourhood, when my attention was arrested
by a Wren, carrying a straw, darting into a small hedge directly beneath
the window at which I stood. In a few minutes the bird reappeared,
and flew to a piece of old thatch which was lying near, and
having disengaged another straw he immediately returned with it to
the place in which the first had been deposited. For about two hours
this operation was continued by the bird with the greatest diligence.
He then abandoned his task, and ascending the highest twig of the
hedge, he poured forth his sweet and merry notes, until driven away
by some person passing near. For the remainder of the evening I saw
no more of the little architect, but on the following morning, being
drawn to the window by his song, I observed him leave his favourite
perch and resume with ardour the employment of the previous day.
During the forenoon I was not able to pay much attention to the movements
of the Wren, but from an occasional glance I observed that his
task, with the exception of a few intervals of relaxation, when his
merry warble fell upon the ear, was plied with a degree of bustling activity
which was worthy of the important undertaking. On examining
his labours at the close of the second day, I observed that the exterior
of a large spherical nest was nearly finished, and that from the old
thatch, though exceedingly moist and black from decay, all the materials
had been obtained. By the afternoon of the ensuing day his visits
to the thatch were discontinued, and he kept bustling and flirting about
the spot. He seemed from his lengthened intervals of song rather to
be exulting in the progress, than to be making any addition to the
work. In the evening I inspected the nest, and found the exterior
complete, and by carefully inserting my finger, I ascertained that no
lining had yet been applied, in consequence most probably of the moisture
which still remained in the straw. Returning to the spot in about
half an hour afterwards, with one of my cousins, to look at the nest, I
observed with no small surprise that the little bird had not only resented
the intrusion by closing up the aperture, but also had opened
another passage from the opposite side of the hedge. The aperture was
closed with pieces of the old thatch, and the work was so neatly executed
that no traces of the former entrance were perceptible. The
nest was altogether the work of one bird, and during the time he spent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_438' href='#Page_438'>438</a></span>
in building we never observed another Wren in his company. In the
choice of the materials, as well as in the situation of the nest, there
was something exceedingly curious. Though the bottom and sides of
the garden were enclosed by a thick hedge, in which he could have
built in perfect security, and where, from the vicinity of the stables,
abundance of fresh materials could have been easily obtained, yet the
old thatch and the hedge at the head of the garden were preferred.
This part of the hedge was young and thin, and separated from the
buildings by a narrow path, which was constantly frequented by the
servants of the establishment. Interruptions from this source, however,
he did not seem to mind, for though often driven from his task
he returned the next moment with as much confidence as if he had
never been disturbed.  Even when his nest was destroyed by the
wantonness of a stranger, he did not abandon the place, but continued
to carry straws from the old thatch with as much diligence as before.
From the extreme caution, however, which he subsequently displayed,
and the circuitous routes which he took, I never could discover the
spot which he selected for his second nest.”
</p>

<p>
The Winter Wren so closely resembles the European Wren, that
I was long persuaded of their identity; but a careful comparison of a
great number of specimens, has convinced me that permanent differences
in colouring may be pointed out, although still, I am not by any
means persuaded that they are specifically different.

<p class="p2">
The young bird just ready to fly, has the bill bright yellow, excepting
the ridge of the upper mandible, which is brown; the feet yellowish-brown.
The upper parts are reddish-brown, faintly barred with
dusky; the wings as in the adult, but the secondary coverts with only
a very small dull white spot at the tip, and the first row of coverts with
a line of the same colour along the shaft. The lower parts are dull
greyish-brown, with the terminal margin of each feather darker, and
the sides and hind parts barred with dusky.
</p>

<p class="p2">
On comparing numerous specimens of American and European
birds, it is found that the proportions of the parts are nearly the same,
and the colours generally similar. But the American birds generally
have the lower parts more tinged with red, their general colour being
pale reddish-brown, whereas those of the European birds are pale
greyish-brown; in the former the bars on the sides and hind parts are
much darker, advance farther on the breast, and in some specimens are
seen even on the neck; in the latter the bars are dusky, and never appear
on the middle of the breast, much less on the neck. In old European
birds, the axillars and lower wing-coverts are greyish-white, without
spots; in old American birds, even those of which the neck is unbarred,
the axillars and lower wing-coverts are always barred with
dusky. As to the two rows of white spots on the wings, they seem to
be quite similar in the birds of both continents, and in those of each
exhibit variations in form, sometimes being short and somewhat triangular,
sometimes also extending along the shaft. The tarsi, toes,
and claws are precisely similar, as are the wings, and it does not appear
that in the American bird the claws are larger, or the wings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_441' href='#Page_441'>441</a></span>
longer, as might be supposed by a person desirous of proving the one
to be more scansorial and migratory than the other. Perhaps the European
bird is somewhat larger, and it certainly differs a little in colour.
After one has studied the differences, he can easily select from a promiscuous
assemblage of skins the European or the American specimens.
But, after all, the differences are very slight, and certainly not such as
to form good essential characters. Were the two species to be comparatively
characterized, they might be described as follows.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>T. europæa.</i> In the male the upper parts reddish-brown, faintly
barred with dusky, the lower parts pale greyish-brown, the sides and
abdomen barred with dusky and greyish-white, the fore neck and breast
without bars, the lower wing-coverts and axillars greyish-white.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>T. hyemalis.</i> In the male the upper parts reddish-brown, faintly
barred with dusky, the lower parts pale reddish-brown, the sides and

greyish-white, barred with dusky.

<h2>
ROCK WREN.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Troglodytes obsoletus</i>, Say.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLX. Adult Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
This species was discovered by some of Major <span class="smcap">Long</span>’s exploring
party, and first described by Mr <span class="smcap">Thomas Say</span>. My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas
Nuttall</span>, who had opportunities of studying its habits, during his
recent journey in company with Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, has assured me that
they are very similar to those of the other Wrens. The figure in
the plate was taken from an adult female, given to me by Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>;
and I have since then obtained two males. In my drawing the bird
was represented on a stone, but for the reasons mentioned in my Introduction,
my son <span class="smcap">Victor Gifford</span> attached it to the drawing of the
Winter Wren, so that it now appears perched on a twig, which, however,
is not a common practice with this species.
</p>

<p>
“On the 21st of June,” says Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, “on the ledges of the
bluffs which border the bottom of Hare’s Fork of the Siskadee (or Colorado
of the West), I heard, and at length saw this curious Mountain
Wren. Its actions are those of the Carolina species, <i>Troglodytes ludovicianus</i>.
The old female (as I supposed) sat upon a ledge of rock at the head
of a high ravine in the bluff, cocking her tail, and balancing herself, at the
same time uttering a <i>tshurr</i>, <i>tshurr</i>, and <i>té aigh</i>, with a strong guttural accent,
and now and then, when approached, like the common Short-billed
Marsh Wren, <i>Troglodytes brevirostris</i>, a quick guttural <i>tshe de de</i>. It has
also a shrill call at times, as it perches on a stone on the summit of some
hill, again similar to the note of the Carolina Wren, occasionally interrupted
by a <i>tshurr</i>. Among these arid and bare hills of the central table-land
they were quite common. The old ones were feeding and watching
a brood of four or five young, which, though fully grown, were protected
and cherished with the querulous assiduity so characteristic of the other
Wrens. They breed under the rocky ledges where we so constantly
observed them, under which they skulk at once when surprised, and
pertinaciously hide in security, like so many rats. Indeed so suddenly
do they disappear among the rocks, and remain so silent in their retreat,
that it is scarcely possible to believe them beneath your feet till
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_444' href='#Page_444'>444</a></span>
after a lapse of a few minutes you begin to hear a low cautious chirp,
and the next moment, at the head of the ravine, the old female probably
again appears, scolding and jerking in the most angry attitudes
she is capable of assuming. In the same rocky retreats they are commonly
accompanied by a kind of small striped Ground Squirrel, like
that of the eastern coast in many respects, but much smaller. These
little animals, which are numerous, the White-chinned Buzzard, <i>Buteo
vulgaris</i> of <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> and <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>, and the Raven frequently hover
over and pounce upon. We met with this species as far west as the
lowest falls of the Columbia, or within a few miles of Fort Van Couver,
but among rocks and cliffs as usual.”

<h2>
DUSKY GROUS.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tetrao obscurus</i>, Say.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXI. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
As I have never seen this species in its native haunts, I am obliged
to have recourse to the observations of those who have had opportunities
of studying its habits. The only accounts that can be depended upon
are those of Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, and Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, which
I here give in order, beginning with what is stated respecting it in
the Fauna Boreali-Americana by the first of these naturalists.
</p>

<p>
“This large Grous inhabits the Rocky Mountains from latitude
40° to 60°, and perhaps to a greater extent, for the limits of its range
either northward or southward have not been ascertained. It has been
known to the fur-traders for nearly thirty years; but it was first introduced
to the scientific world by Mr <span class="smcap">Say</span>, who, in 1820, accompanied
Major <span class="smcap">Long</span> to the source of the Missouri; and a female specimen, deposited
by him in the Philadelphia Museum, has lately been figured by
the Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span> in his continuation of Wilson’s Ornithology.
I had no opportunity of observing the habits of this bird myself, but
was informed by Mr <span class="smcap">Drummond</span> that, in the mornings during pairing
time, usual station of the male is on some rocky eminence or large
stone, where he sits swelling out the sides of his neck, spreading his
tail, and repeating the cry of “Coombe, Coombe,” in a soft hollow
tone. Its food consists of various berries, and its flesh is very palatable.
Mr <span class="smcap">Alexander Stewart</span>, a chief-factor of the Hudson’s Bay
Company, who has often crossed the mountains, informs me that the
males of this species fight each other with such animosity, that a man
may take one of them up in his hand before it will quit its antagonist.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> adds in a note, that “the description and figure
of Mr <span class="smcap">Say</span>’s specimen agree so completely with our younger female
specimens, that there can be no doubt of their specific identity; but it
is proper to observe that there is some discrepancy in the dimensions.
The Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span> states the total length of the bird to be
eighteen inches, that of the wing nine inches and a half. The wing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_447' href='#Page_447'>447</a></span>
of the largest of our males is scarcely so long; while the biggest of
our females, measuring twenty-one inches in total length, has a wing
barely eight inches long. This, perhaps, merely indicates the uncertainty
of measurements taken from prepared specimens. Mr <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>’s
specimens in the Edinburgh Museum are of younger birds than
ours, but evidently the same species.” These remarks correspond
with what I have so often repeated, that age, sex, and different states
of moult, produce disparities in individuals of the same species.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, in the notes with which he has favoured me, has the
following observations:—“Dusky Grous, <i>Tetrao obscurus</i>. <i>Qul-al-lalleun</i>
of the Chinooks. First found in the Blue Mountains, near Wallah
Wallah, in large flocks, in September. Keep in pine woods altogether,
never found on the plains; they perch on the trees. Afterwards found
on the Columbia River in pairs in May. The eggs are numerous, of a
cinereous brown colour, blunt at both ends, and small for the size of
the bird. The actions of the female, when the young are following her,
are precisely the same as the Ruffed Grous, using all the arts of that
bird in counterfeiting lameness, &amp;c. Female smaller than the male,
lighter coloured, and wants the yellow warty skin upon the sides of the
neck.”
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s notice is as follows:—“The Dusky Grous breeds
in the shady forests of the Columbia, where we heard and saw them
throughout the summer. The male at various times of the day makes
a curious uncouth tooting, almost like the sound made by blowing into
the bung-hole of a barrel, <i>boo wh’h</i>, <i>wh’h</i>, <i>wh’h</i>, <i>wh’h</i>, the last note descending
into a kind of echo. We frequently tried to steal on the performer,
but without success, as, in fact, the sound is so strangely managed
that you may imagine it to come from the left or right indifferently.
They breed on the ground, as usual, and the brood keep together nearly
all winter. The Ruffed Grous also breeds here commonly, and I one
day found the nest concealed near a fallen log, but it was at once forsaken
after this intrusion, though I did not touch the eggs.”
</p>

<p>
From the examination of specimens in my possession, I am persuaded
that this species, like <i>Tetrao Cupido</i>, has the means of inflating
the sacs of bare skin on the sides of the neck, by means of which, in
the breeding season, are produced the curious sounds above described.

the lateral feathers being 7 twelfths shorter than the longest remaining,
the middle feathers being lost. The tail is deep black, with a
terminal band of ash-grey, half an inch in breadth. It is therefore
probable, that when the tail is unworn, it is distinctly rounded, and
tipped with grey.

<p>
I have conferred on this beautiful bird the name of a most zealous,
learned, and enterprising naturalist, my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>,
Esq., to whom the scientific world is deeply indebted for the many
additions to our zoological and botanical knowledge which have resulted
from his labours. It is to him alone that we owe all that is
known respecting the present species, which has not hitherto been
portrayed. In a note inserted by him in my journal, he says:
</p>

<p>
“As we proceed to the south in Upper California, around the
village of Sta. Barbara, we find the Common Magpie substituted by
this remarkable species, which is much more shy and cautious, as
well as more strictly insectivorous. It utters, however, nearly if not
quite the same chatter. In the month of April they were everywhere
mated, and had nearly completed their nests in the evergreen oaks of
the vicinity (<i>Quercus agrifolia</i>). The only one I saw was situated on
a rather high tree, towards the summit, and much concealed among
the thick and dark branches. Their call was <i>pait</i>, <i>pait</i>; and on approaching
each other, a low congratulatory chatter was heard. After
being fired at once, it seemed nearly impossible again to approach them
within gun-shot. When alighted in the thick oaks, they remained for
a considerable time silent, and occasionally even wholly hid themselves;
but after a while the call of recognition was again renewed, and if the
pair then met, they would often fly off a mile or more, without stopping,
in quest of insects. We often saw them on the ground, but
never near the offal of the oxen, so attractive to the Crows and Ravens
around.”

In form, proportion, and size, this Magpie is precisely similar to
the common species.  Its bill has the sides less convex; the bare

the same manner; but the bill of the present species is yellow, instead
of black, and the black of the back and fore neck is tinged with brown.
The two species are wonderfully closely allied; but on comparing my
specimen with several others in the Museum of the Zoological Society
of London, I found that they all precisely agreed with it.

<h2>
STELLER’S JAY.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Corvus Stelleri</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXII. Adult.</span>
</p>


<p>
Of this Jay, discovered by <span class="smcap">Steller</span>, whose name it bears, Dr
<span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states that it “is not uncommon in the summer time on
the Pacific coast of America, from the mouth of the Columbia to the
56th parallel. It also frequents the Rocky Mountains, where Mr
<span class="smcap">Drummond</span> procured a specimen. In its manner it greatly resembles
the <i>Garrulus cristatus</i>.” Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s account of it is as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“We first observed this bird in our Western route in the Blue
Mountains of the Columbia, east of Wallah Wallah. Here they were
scarce and shy, but we met them in sufficient abundance in the
majestic pine forests of the Columbia, where, in autumn, their loud
and trumpeting clangour was heard at all hours of the day, calling out
<i>djay</i>, <i>djay</i>, and sometimes chattering and uttering a variety of other
notes scarcely recognisable as distinct from the calls of our common
Blue Jay. They are, however, far more bold, irritable, and familiar.
Watchful as dogs, a stranger no sooner shews himself in their vicinity
then they neglect all other employment to come round, follow, peep at
and scold him, sometimes with such pertinacity and irritability as to
provoke the sportsman intent on other game to level his gun against
them in mere retaliation. At other times, stimulated by mere curiosity,
they will be observed to follow you in perfect silence, until
something arouses their ready ire, when the <i>djay</i>, <i>djay</i>, <i>pay</i>, <i>pay</i>, is
poured upon you without intermission, till you are beyond their view.
So intent are they on vociferating, that it is not uncommon to hear
them busily scolding even while engaged with a large acorn in the
mouth. Of their geographical limits we are as yet uncertain. They
were first found by <span class="smcap">Steller</span> at Nootka; but they do not extend into
upper California, and scarcely to the west as far as the most western
of the true Rocky Mountain Chains. They feed on insects, acorns,
and the seeds of the gigantic pines which form a belt along the Pacific
and the rivers of the Oregon Territory. In the month of May, I
found a nest of this species in a small sapling of Douglas’s Fir, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_454' href='#Page_454'>454</a></span>
borders of a dark and dense forest, and again some time after a second
nest with young, in an elevated branch of the same pine, on the border
of a rocky cliff. On approaching the nest, which contained four eggs,
of a pale green colour, with small olive-brown specks, varied with
others of rather a violet hue, both the male and female flew at me with
the utmost anger and agitation, deafening me almost with their cries
and entreaties. But though I took only two of their eggs, I found
next day that they had forsaken the nest, being too fearful and jealous
of the intrusion to remain any longer in the same place. The
nest as usual was bulky, made of interlaced twigs, and roots, with a
stout layer of mud, and lined with black root-fibres. I saw the nest
about ten days previous to the time of taking two of the four eggs.
On that occasion the female (probably) only followed me in silence.”

<p>
Although the Ultramarine Jay has been described by Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>,
in his Synopsis of the Birds of Mexico, under the name of <i>Garrulus
sordidus</i>, I retain the specific name “<i>ultramarinus</i>,” previously
given by the Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>. The only observations respecting
its habits that I am aware of having been made, are the following,
for which I am indebted to my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>.
</p>

<p>
“Early in October, on arriving in the forests of the Columbia,
near Fort Vancouver, an establishment of the Hudson’s Bay Company,
we saw in the same situations with the Steller’s Jay, the present species.
Its habits are much like those of the Common Jay. It usually
flies out to the tops of the lofty pines, jerks its tail, and perches playfully
on some extreme branch, where it utters at times, as if excited
by petulant anger, a strong <i>whoit</i>, <i>woit</i>, <i>woit</i>, <i>woit</i>, after which expression
it emits a sort of recognition-call at short intervals, <i>twee</i>, and
sometimes a shorter <i>’twee ’twee</i>. When much pursued, it sits still in
the concealing shade of the lofty branches on which it seeks refuge.
It feeds on insects, acorns broken up, and probably pine seeds. They
appear to associate in roving families throughout the fall and winter,
like the other species, seldom if ever associating with the more Common
Steller’s Jay, though now and then perhaps in the same tree. It
is a graceful, active, and rather shy species, flying out straight from
tree to tree, remarkable by its long tail and rather short wings; and
its note is much less harsh and loud than that of Steller’s Jay. They
breed in the dark pine woods probably where we so frequently saw
them alight, and on the 15th of June they were feeding their fully
fledged young, two of which I pursued for some time, but they skulked
so effectually as to escape me after a long and doubtful chase. The
young had a great predominance of grey on the back. The same species
also extends into Upper California.”

<p>
No sooner had I examined perfect specimens of this somewhat singularly
coloured bird, than I felt assured, more especially from the
form of its bill, that it is with us a representative of the Nutcracker of
Europe; and I was much surprised, on comparing it with the figure
given of it by <span class="smcap">Alexander Wilson</span>, to find the latter very defective,
the bill being nearly half an inch shorter than in four specimens which
I have inspected. All that is known of its habits is contained in the
following notes from Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> and Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>.
</p>

<p>
“We first observed this species in a small pine grove, on the borders
of Bear River, in the table-land of the Rocky Mountains, where
they were probably breeding, in the month of July. We again saw a
considerable flock of the young birds early in August, in a lofty ravine
near the summit of one of the three belts or isolated mountains, about
thirty or forty miles west of the Shoshonee River. They appeared
somewhat shy, and scattered through a grove of aspens, flying with a
slight chatter, scarcely a caw, from the tops of the bushes or trees, on
to the ground, probably in quest of insect food. We never saw this
species either on the lower plains or forests of the Columbia, or in any
part of Upper California. It appears never to descend below the mountain
plains.” T. N.
</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Clarke</span>’s Crow, <i>Corvus columbianus</i>. First found on Bear River,
and afterwards on the Blue Mountains, plentiful. Its flight is very
unlike that of the Common Crow, being performed by jerks, like that
of the Woodpecker. When sitting, it is almost constantly screaming;
its voice is very harsh and grating, and consists of one rather prolonged
note. It breeds here in very high pine trees. The White Pelican
also seen here in July, no doubt breeds; also the Canvass-backed Duck,
the Shoveller, and Dusky Duck; found young of all of them. The
<i>Corvus columbianus</i> is never seen within five hundred miles of the mouth
of the Columbia. It appears generally to prefer a mountainous country
and pine trees; and feeds chiefly on insects and their larvæ.” J. K. T.

<p>
The first intimations of the occurrence of this beautiful bird in North
America, were made by Mr <span class="smcap">Drummond</span> and Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, by the
former of whom it was found in 1826, near the sources of the Athabasca,
or Elk River, in the spring, and by the latter, in the same season,
at Great Bear Lake, in latitude 50°. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states, in
the Fauna Boreali-Americana, that “specimens procured at the former
place, and transmitted to England, by the servants of the Hudson’s
Bay Company, were communicated, by Mr <span class="smcap">Leadbeater</span> to the Prince
of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>, who had introduced the species into his great work on
the Birds of the United States.” “In its autumn migration southwards,”
he continues, “this bird must cross the territory of the United States,
if it does not actually winter within it; but I have not heard of its
having been hitherto seen in America to the southward of the fifty-fifth
parallel of latitude. The mountainous nature of the country skirting
the Northern Pacific Ocean being congenial to the habits of this species,
it is probably more generally diffused in New Caledonia and the
Russian American Territories, than to the eastward of the Rocky
Mountain chain. It appears in flocks at Great Bear Lake about the
24th of May, when the spring thaw has exposed the berries of the alpine
arbutus, marsh vaccinium, &amp;c., that have been frozen and covered
during winter. It stays only for a few days, and none of the Indians of
that quarter with whom I conversed had seen its nests; but I have
reason to believe, that it retires in the breeding season to the rugged
and secluded mountain-limestone districts, in the sixty-seventh and
sixty-eighth parallels, where it feeds on the fruit of the common juniper,
which abounds in those places.” In a note, he further states:—“I
observed a large flock, consisting of at least three or four hundred
individuals, on the banks of the Saskatchewan at Carlton House, early
in May 1827. They alighted in a grove of poplars, settling all on one
or two trees, and making a loud twittering noise. They stayed only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' href='#Page_463'>463</a></span>
about one hour in the morning, and were too shy to allow me to approach
within gunshot.”
</p>

<p>
I am informed by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, who has spent about four years
in the Columbia River district and on the Rocky Mountains, that he
did not observe there a single bird of this species. In the autumn of
1832, whilst rambling near Boston, my sons saw a pair, which they pursued
more than an hour, but without success. The most southern locality
in which I have known it to be procured, is the neighbourhood
of Philadelphia, where, as well as on Long Island, several were shot
in 1830 and 1832. The specimens from which I made the figures of
the male and female represented in the plate, were given to me by my
friend <span class="smcap">Thomas M’Culloch</span> of Pictou, in Nova Scotia, who procured
several others in the winter of 1834. The following account of the affection
displayed by one towards its companion, with which he has also
favoured me, will be found highly interesting.
</p>

<p>
“During the winter of 1834, many species of the northern birds
were more than usually abundant in the province of Nova Scotia, being
driven, no doubt, from their customary places of resort by the cold
which was very intense at the commencement of the season. Large
flocks of the <i>Loxia Enucleator</i> appeared in every part of the country,
while the <i>Fringilla Linaria</i>, of which we had not seen a single specimen
for upwards of two years, could be shot at almost any hour of the
day, in the streets of Pictou; and we were often told of birds being
seen, which from the description we could not recognise as belonging
to any species with which we were already acquainted. The first day
of the year having proved uncommonly mild, I went out, accompanied
by my father, with the expectation of obtaining something new for our
collection of birds. We had scarcely left our own door when we observed
a small flock alight in a thicket of evergreens a short distance
from where we stood. Thinking they were Pine Grosbeaks, we directed
the man who was with us to push on and obtain a shot. He did so,
and we just arrived in time to pick up a pair of birds which he had
killed. One glance was sufficient to shew us that they were not what
we had supposed, but a species we had never previously seen or heard
of as visiting that portion of the Continent. You, my dear Sir, have
often enjoyed such moments, and therefore can easily conceive the intense
delight with which we surveyed our prize, and how anxiously we
watched the progress of the remainder, as they flew to an adjoining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_464' href='#Page_464'>464</a></span>
thicket, where one immediately disappeared, while the other took its
station on the top of a spruce, from which its simple <i>tze tze tze</i> was uttered
with the greatest vehemence, as if calling on its companions to
hasten from the danger which it had recently escaped. Seeing the bird
so very watchful, we made a small circuit with the view of diverting
its attention, and at the same time of looking for the one by which
it was accompanied, as I conceived it to be severely wounded, from
the apparent difficulty of its flight. After a careful examination of
the bush we at length observed it upon a low twig, and from its inattention
to the calls of its mate, and the cowering position in which it
sat, I concluded that it was unable to make another attempt to escape.
Giving it an occasional glance, we turned towards the other, which
still retained its former station on the top of the spruce, though its uneasiness
seemed to increase at every step. While the man was cautiously
working his way through the thick alder, in order to get within
shot, I carefully examined the bird, which certainly presented a very interesting
object. It stood almost as upright as the top on which it was
perched, its height being much increased by its long and graceful crest
being quite erect, while at the same time its wings were kept in a constant
jerking motion, as if in readiness to remove at a moment’s notice. Independent
of the mere beauty of the bird, there was something deeply interesting
in the anxiety for the safety of its mate, so touchingly displayed
by the force and rapidity of its simple but affectionate warning. The motion
of the alders frightened the bird, and I had the mortification of seeing
it rise in the air, as if about to commence a lofty and long-continued
flight. Unwilling to give it up, I watched its progress with longing eyes,
but at last, when about turning away in despair, it suddenly wheeled
about, dashed by with great velocity, gently brushed its companion,
and thus by dispelling its stupor induced it to make another effort to
escape the danger which threatened its destruction. Though surprised
and delighted with this singular display of fidelity and affection, I felt
not a little disappointed to see them both about to elude our grasp.
The weakness of the wounded bird, however, soon induced it to seek
concealment in another thicket, while the other, still faithful to a
friend in distress, alighted as formerly on a spruce top, whence it could
both see and warn it of approaching danger. As we again drew near,
its anxiety seemed to be redoubled, while its notes were uttered with
corresponding quickness and energy; but before we could get within
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_465' href='#Page_465'>465</a></span>
reach, it again launched into the air, and made off, calling on the other
to follow with all possible speed. After flying for some time, and
finding itself unattended, it again returned and alighted on a top near
the one it had just left. The opportunity was too good to be lost, and
notwithstanding our admiration of this additional instance of its fidelity,
we shot it down, affection for its species being the occasion of its ruin.
These, my dear Sir, are all the observations I was enabled to make
upon these interesting birds, during the short and only time they ever
came under my notice. From the man I learned that before the first
shot they were quite mute, and unsuspicious of danger. Some days
after these were obtained, a single one was observed by my father repeatedly
to come and sit for a considerable time on some willows at
the bottom of our garden, but not being accustomed to the use of a gun,
he did not procure it. Whether this was the wounded one or not, we
could not tell, but from the affection of the bird for its kind, we thought
that possibly it might be that one in search of its lost companions.”

<p>
I found this species quite common on the islands near the entrance
of the Bay of Fundy, which I visited early in May 1833. They were
then journeying northwards, although many pass the whole year in the
northern parts of the State of Maine, and the British provinces of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, where, however, they seem to have been
overlooked, or confounded with our Common American Crossbill. Those
which I met with on the islands mentioned above were observed on
their margins, some having alighted on the bare rocks, and all those
which were alarmed immediately took to wing, rose to a moderate
height, and flew directly eastward. On my passage across the Gulf of
St Laurence to Labrador, in the same month, about a dozen White-winged
Crossbills, and as many Mealy Redpolls, one day alighted
on the top-yards of the Ripley; but before we could bring our guns
from below, they all left us, and flew ahead of the vessel, as if intent
on pointing out to us the place to which we were bound. On the
30th of June, a beautiful male was shot, on a bunch of grass growing
out of the fissure of a rock, on a small island a few miles from the coast
of Labrador; and on the 23d of July, my young friend Dr <span class="smcap">George
Shattuck</span>, procured a fine adult female on the Murre Islands, whilst
she was feeding among the scanty herbage.
</p>

<p>
Within the limits of the United States, I have obtained some during
winter along the hilly shores of the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania;
also in New Jersey, and in one instance in Maryland, a few
miles from Baltimore, beyond which southward I have never met with
this species, nor have I heard of any having been seen there. According
to Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, who resided about four years on the Columbia
River, none are met with in that region. As it appears that individuals
accidentally visit Europe, I am led to think that the true summer
haunts of this species are as yet not better known than those of the Bohemian
Chatterer and Common Crossbill. The latter has been shot in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_468' href='#Page_468'>468</a></span>
winter by my son <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>, within a few miles of Charleston
in South Carolina, where several were seen, and the specimen he procured
there is now in the collection of my friend the Reverend <span class="smcap">John
Bachman</span>.
</p>

<p>
The southward migration of this Crossbill, as well as of the other,
is extremely irregular. Being evidently hardy birds, they appear to prefer
northern to temperate climates, and to shift their station only during
the most severe cold. The comparatively small number that spend the
year in Maine and the British Provinces adjoining, may be forced to do
so by wounds or other accidents, as in general I have found them
moving toward the north as soon as the chill blasts of winter were
tempered by the warmer rays of the vernal sun.
</p>

<p>
The habits of the White-winged Crossbill are in general similar to
those of our common species. Its flight is well sustained and undulated;
it is easily approached, is fond of saline substances, uses its bill
and feet in the manner of Parrots, and procures its food from the cones
of pines. Its song is at times mellow and agreeable, and in captivity
it becomes gentle and familiar.
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Hutchins</span> says that this species reaches Hudson’s Bay in the
month of March, and breeds in May, forming a nest of grass, mud, and
feathers, about midway up pine trees, and laying five white eggs, marked
with yellowish spots. The young are abroad in the end of June,
and the species remains in that country until the latter part of November.
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states that it “inhabits the dense white spruce
forests of the Fur Countries, feeding principally on the seeds of cones.
It ranges through the whole breadth of the continent, and probably up
to the sixty-eighth parallel, where the woods terminate, though it was
not observed by us higher than the sixty-second. It is mostly seen on
the upper branches of the trees, and, when wounded, clings so fast,
that it will remain suspended after death. In September it collects in
small flocks, which fly from tree to tree, making a chattering noise;
and in the depth of winter it retires from the coast to the thick woods
of the interior.”

LAPLAND LONGSPUR.

<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXV. Male and Female.</span>

<p>
My first acquaintance with this species took place on the 15th of
February 1819. Walking with my wife, on the afternoon of that day,
in the neighbourhood of Henderson, in Kentucky, I saw immense flocks
scattered over the open grounds on the elevated grassy banks of the
Ohio. Having my gun with me, as usual, I procured more than
sixty in a few minutes. All the youths of the village turned out on
this occasion, and a relative of mine, in the course of the next day
killed about six hundred. Although in rather poor condition, we found
them excellent eating. Three days after they disappeared as suddenly
as they had arrived, for although on the previous evening they
seemed as numerous as ever, none but wounded birds were to be seen
in the morning. Whilst at Shippingport, near Louisville, in the same
State, I found a good number of these birds on the commons, feeding
in company with Shore Larks and Snow Buntings, and obtained some
dozens. Among all the specimens which I procured in that part of
the country, none were in perfect or summer plumage, most of them
being in the garb of the male, as represented by the second figure of
my plate.
</p>

<p>
In their movements they resemble the Snow Bunting. They run
and hop on the ground with ease and celerity, many making towards a
tuft of withered grass at the same time, to search for the few seeds
that may yet be procured around or beneath it, and all the while uttering
a repetition of <i>chips</i>, in a rather low and plaintive accent. When
on wing, to which they resorted after each discharge of the gun, or
when nearly approached, they formed into compact bodies, wheeled
and cut to and fro through the air, now high, now low, in the manner
of Larks, alighting suddenly, and perhaps immediately flying off again
to renew their curious evolutions. At times flocks composed of hundreds
would settle on the top-rails of fences, or on the lower large
branches of the trees in the fields; but on such occasions they appeared
as much discontented as the Snow Buntings are, when they also alight
on trees, fences, or houses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_473' href='#Page_473'>473</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Lapland Longspur visits the neighbourhood of Louisville in
Kentucky almost every year, but seldom appears when the weather is
not intensely cold. I found it also in the vicinity of St Genevieve in
Missouri; and it seems surprising that none were observed near the
Columbia River by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>.
</p>

<p>
The best account of this species, as observed in the northern latitudes
of America where it breeds, is that given by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, in
the Fauna Boreali-Americana. After stating that it is common in the
northern regions of both continents, he says:—“I never met with this
species in the interior of the Fur Countries during winter, and I suspect
that its principal retreats in that season are on the borders of Lakes
Huron and Superior, and in the country extending to the westward on
the same parallel. In the year 1827, it appeared on the plains at Carlton
House, about the middle of May, in very large flocks, among which
were many Shore Larks (<i>Alauda alpestris</i>) and a few individuals of
<i>Emberiza picta</i>. During their stay of ten or twelve days, they frequented
open spots, where recent fires had destroyed the grass. They
came to Cumberland House a few days later in the same season, and
there kept constantly in the furrows of a newly ploughed field. In the
preceding year they were seen, though in smaller flocks, in the vicinity
of Fort Franklin (lat. <span class="mixfract">65&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>°) in the beginning of May; and the crops of
those that were then killed were filled with the seeds of the <i>Arbutus
alpina</i>. They breed in the moist meadows on the shores of the Arctic
Sea. The nest, placed on a small hillock, among moss and stones, is
composed externally of the dry stems of grass, interwoven to a considerable
thickness, and lined very neatly and compactly with Deer’s
hair. The eggs, usually seven, are pale ochre-yellow, spotted with
brown.”
</p>

<p>
The figure of the male in summer plumage represented in my plate,
was drawn from a beautiful specimen in the collection of my esteemed
friend, Captain <span class="smcap">James Ross</span> of the British Navy.

ICELAND OR JER FALCON.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Falco islandicus</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXVI. Adult Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The figures of the adult female of this superb Falcon now before
you were taken from the bird described by Mr <span class="smcap">John Heppenstall</span>, at
page 554 of the second volume of this work. It was kept by him
upwards of six years; and it was his intention to have sent it to me
alive from Sheffield; but it died of an affection of the œsophagus,
which had for some days rendered it unable to swallow its food. My
kind and most worthy friend, however, sent it to me immediately, so
that after having received it in good condition, I was enabled not only
to make it the subject of the present plate, and to take accurate measurements
of all its parts, but also to institute a comparison between it
and one of the specimens obtained in Labrador, which, with its consort,
is represented in Plate CXCVI.
</p>

<p>
In all essential respects it agrees with the Labrador bird. The
festoon on the edge of the lower mandible is however more prominent,
and on the other hand, the tooth which is prominent in the young
bird from Labrador, is in the old Iceland bird broken off and worn
on both sides. In like manner, several of the claws, which are larger
and stronger in this individual, are worn and blunted. These are the
accidents of domestication or long use, and shew that no dependence can
be placed on the prominence of either the festoon or the tooth of the bill
as indicating a difference of species. The tarsi, toes, their scales and
scutella, are the same as in the Labrador specimen. The wing, however,
is more pointed, although the feathers are of the same form; but
this arises from the first quill of the Labrador bird not having completed
its growth, as both it and some of the other quills are still
sheathed at the base. In Mr <span class="smcap">Heppenstall</span>’s bird the second quill is
longest, the third very little shorter, and the first nearly as long, and
three quarters of an inch longer than the fourth. The tail is slightly
rounded, as in the Labrador bird, the lateral feathers being three quarters
of an inch shorter than the longest, and the feathers are similarly
though less distinctly pointed, they having been considerably worn.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' href='#Page_477'>477</a></span>
The plumage is compact, and the feathers are of the same form in both
birds, but those of the head are a little broader in the Iceland bird.
On the whole, however, no differences are observable beyond what
might be expected between a young and an old individual of the same
species. The colouring of the Iceland bird, however, is very different.
</p>

<p>
The bill is very pale blue, the extremity of the upper mandible black,
that of the lower yellowish; the eyes greyish-black; the cere, superciliary
ridge, edges of eyelids, tarsi and toes, pale yellow; the eyelids pale
blue; the claws black. The plumage is pure white, but all the feathers
of the back and rump, the scapulars, the wing-coverts, and the secondary
quills, have near their extremity a brownish-black spot, generally
arrow-shaped. The anterior feathers of the back have, moreover,
a black streak on the shaft, which on those farther back becomes
larger and lanceolate, and on the rump is accompanied by a third
spot; the larger coverts and secondary quills have also three or more
spots, and the primary quills have seven spots or partial bars toward
their extremity, besides a large subterminal black space, their tips
however being white. On the inner margin of the two middle tail-feathers
are eight, and on the outer four dusky spots, and their shafts
are also dusky, as are those of all the quills on their upper surface.
There are also a few slight lanceolate dark spots on the sides of the
body, and on the tibial feathers.

<h2>
BAND-TAILED PIGEON.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Columba fasciata</i>, Say.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
In the course of Colonel <span class="smcap">Say</span>’s expedition to the Rocky Mountains,
a single specimen of this large and handsome Pigeon was procured.
This individual was afterwards figured in the continuation of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s
American Ornithology. Many specimens however have more recently
been obtained by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, from whom I have procured three
pairs of adult and some young birds. Comparing them with the figure
above alluded to, I should consider it as having been taken from
a young male. In my plate are represented two adult birds, placed on
the branch of a superb species of Dogwood, discovered by my learned
friend, <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, Esq., when on his march toward the shores
of the Pacific Ocean, and which I have graced with his name! The
beautiful drawing of this branch was executed by Miss <span class="smcap">Martin</span>,
the amiable and accomplished sister of my friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>. Seeds
of this new species of <i>Cornus</i> were sent by me to Lord <span class="smcap">Ravensworth</span>,
and have germinated, so that this beautiful production of the rich valley
of the Columbia River may now be seen in the vicinity of London,
and in the grounds of the nobleman just mentioned, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>’s notice respecting the bird here spoken of
is as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“The Band-tailed Pigeon is called by the Chinook Indians ‘<i>akoigh
homin</i>.’ It ranges from the eastern spurs of the Rocky Mountains
across to the Columbia River, where it is abundant. It arrived in 1836
in very great numbers, on the 17th of April, and continued in large
flocks while breeding. Their breeding places are on the banks of the
river. The eggs are placed on the ground, under small bushes, without
a nest, where numbers congregate together. The eggs are two,
of a yellowish-white colour, inclining to bluish-white, with minute
spots at the great end. These Pigeons feed upon the berries of the
black elder and the buds of the balsam poplar. When sitting in the
trees, they huddle very close together in the manner of the Carolina
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' href='#Page_480'>480</a></span>
Parrot, and many may be killed at a single discharge of the fowling-piece.
The flesh is tender and juicy, and therefore fine eating.”
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> has favoured me with an equally interesting notice.
“This large and fine Pigeon, always moving about in flocks,
keeps in Oregon only in the thick forests of the Columbia and the
Wahlamet, and during the summer is more particularly abundant in
the alluvial groves of the latter river, where throughout that season
we constantly heard their cooing, or witnessed the swarming flocks
feeding on the berries of the elder tree, those of the Great Cornel
(<i>Cornus Nuttalli</i>), or, before the ripening of berries, on the seed-germs
or the young pods of the Balsam poplar. The call of this species is
somewhat similar to that of the Carolina Dove, but is readily distinguishable,
sounding like a double suppressed syllable, as <i>h ’koo</i>, <i>h ’koo</i>,
<i>h ’koo</i>, <i>h ’koo</i>, uttered at the usual intervals, and repeated an hour or
two at a time, chiefly in the morning and evening. They are said to
breed on the ground, or in the low bushes, but I did not find the nest,
although I saw the birds feeding around every day near Watpatoo
Island. During the whole of this time they keep in flocks, either in
the poplars or elder bushes, and on being started, sweep about like
flocks of domestic pigeons, soon returning to their fare, when they
feed in silence, keeping a strict watch for intruders. They remain
on the lower part of the Columbia nearly the whole year, late in the
season (October and November) feeding mostly on the berries of the
Tree Cornel, but still they seem to migrate some distance to the south,
as the severity of the winter approaches.”

ROCK GROUS.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tetrao rupestris</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXVIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Whilst at Labrador, I was informed by Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, of whom I have
made mention on several occasions, that a smaller species of Ptarmigan
than that called the Willow Grous, <i>Tetrao Saliceti</i>, was abundant on all
the hills around Bras d’Or, during the winter, when he and his son usually
killed a great number, which they salted and otherwise preserved; and
that in the beginning of summer they removed from the coast into the
interior of the country, where they bred in open grounds, never, like
the Willow Grous, retreating to the wooded parts. They seldom appear
at Bras d’Or until the last of the Wild Geese have passed over, or
before the cold has become intense, and the plains deeply covered with
snow. While about his house, they repair to the most elevated hilltops,
from which the violence of the winds has removed the snow.
There they feed on the mosses and lichens attached to the rocks, as well
as on the twigs and grasses scantily found in such places at that season.
They keep in great packs, and when disturbed are apt to fly to a considerable
distance, shifting from one hill to another often half a mile
off.
</p>

<p>
Not having seen this species alive, and my drawing having been
taken from specimens kindly presented to me by my friend Captain
<span class="smcap">James Ross</span>, R. N., I cannot do better than present you here with the
observations of Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, as recorded in the Fauna Boreali-Americana.
“<span class="smcap">Hutchins</span> reports that the Rock Grous is numerous at
the two extremities of Hudson’s Bay, but does not appear at the middle
settlements (York and Severn Factories), except in very severe seasons,
when the Willow Grous are scarce, and Captain <span class="smcap">Sabine</span> informs us
that they abound on Melville Peninsula, Lat. 74° to 75°, in the summer.
It arrived there in its snow-white dress, on the 12th of May
1820; at the end of that month the females began to assume their coloured
plumage, which was complete by the first week in June, the change
at the latter period being only in its commencement with the males.
Some of the males were killed as late as the middle of June in their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_484' href='#Page_484'>484</a></span>
unaltered winter plumage. In this respect the species differs from the
Willow Grous whose males first assume the summer colour. The
Rock Grous is found also on Melville Peninsula and the Barren
Grounds, seldom going farther south in winter than latitude 63° in the
interior, but descending along the coast of Hudson’s Bay to latitude
58°, and in severe seasons still farther to the southward. It also occurs
on the Rocky Mountains as far south as latitude 55°. It exists in
Greenland, is common in Norway, is known in Sweden by the name of
<i>Sno Rissa</i>, and is the species most frequent in the Museums of France
and Italy under the name of <i>Tetrao Lagopus</i>. It is not a native of
Scotland. The Rock Grous in its manners and mode of living resembles
the Willow Grous, except that it does not retire so far into the
woody country in winter. Contrary, however, to what <span class="smcap">Hearne</span> says,
it is frequent in open woods on the borders of lakes in that season,
particularly in the 65th parallel of latitude, though perhaps the bulk
of the species remains on the skirts of the Barren Grounds. It hatches
in June. The ground colour of the egg is, according to Captain
<span class="smcap">Sabine</span>, a pale reddish-brown, and is irregularly spotted and blotched
with darker brown.” Specimens in my possession, coloured as here
described, average one inch and five-eighths in length, by an inch and
an eighth in breadth.

<p class="p2">
Very great differences are observed in the length and form of the
claws, they being in some individuals very long, thin-edged, and tapering,
to a rounded point; in others very short, being worn down to
the stump. This species is considerably smaller than the Ptarmigan
of Scotland, which it precisely resembles in its winter plumage. In its
summer plumage, however, it differs in having the markings larger;
and as yet no specimens have been obtained marked with undulated
slender, ash-grey, and dusky lines, in any degree approaching those
characteristic of the British bird in its autumnal plumage. The bill
of the Rock Grous is shorter and thicker than that of the Ptarmigan,
although the reverse has been alleged.

<span class="smcap"><i>Turdus montanus.</i></span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXIX. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
This interesting and hitherto unfigured species was procured on
the Rocky Mountains by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, who forwarded a single specimen
to Philadelphia, where I made a drawing of it. The following
notice by Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> shews that it is nearly allied in its habits to
the Mocking Bird:—
</p>

<p>
“On the arid plains of the central table-land, betwixt the northern
sources of the Platte and the Colorado of the West, in the month of
June, we frequently heard the cheering song of this delightful species,
whose notes considerably resemble those of the Brown Thrush, with
some of the imitative powers of the Mocking Bird. For a great part
of the day, and especially early and late, its song resounds through the
desert plains, as it warbles to its mate from some tall weed or bush of
wormwood, and continues with little interruption nearly for an hour at
a time. We met with it in the plains exclusively, till our arrival at
Wallah Wallah, but we are not certain of having seen it in any part
of California, it being apparently entirely confined to the cooler and
open regions of the Rocky Mountains.  Just before arriving at Sandy
Creek of the Colorado, while resting for refreshment at noon, I had
the good fortune to find the nest in a wormwood bush, on the margin
of a ravine, from whence the male was singing with its unusual energy.
It contained four almost emerald green eggs, spotted with dark olive
of two shades, more numerous towards the greater end, the spots large
and roundish. The nest itself was made of small twigs and rough
stalks, lined with stripes of bark and bison wool. The female flew off
to a little distance, and looked on her unwelcome and unexpected visitor,
without uttering either call or complaint.”

<h2>
VARIED THRUSH.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Turdus nævius</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXIX. Adult Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
Of this beautiful Thrush, of which a figure not having the black
band running quite across the breast, as is the case in the adult male,
is given by Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>, in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, Dr
<span class="smcap">Richardson</span> speaks as follows:—“This species was discovered at
Nootka Sound, in Captain COOK’S third voyage, and male and female
specimens, in the possession of Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span>, were described by
<span class="smcap">Latham</span>: <span class="smcap">Pennant</span> has also described and figured the same male.
The specimen represented in this work was procured at Fort Franklin,
lat. <span class="mixfract">65&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>°, in the spring of 1826. We did not hear its song, nor acquire
any information respecting its habits, except that it built its
nest in a bush, similar to that of the <i>Merula migratoria</i>. It was not
seen by us on the banks of the Saskatchewan; and, as it has not appeared
in the list of the Birds of the United States, it most probably
does not go far to the eastward of the Rocky Mountains in its migrations
north and south. It may perhaps be more common to the westward
of that ridge.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>’s conjecture as to the line of march followed by
it has proved to be correct, Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> and Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> having
found it abundant on the western sides of the Rocky Mountains. The
former of these zealous naturalists informs me that he “first found this
Thrush on the Columbia River in the month of October, and that it
becomes more numerous in winter, which it spends in that region,
though some remove farther south. It there associates with the Common
Robin, <i>Turdus migratorius</i>, but possesses a very different note, it being
louder, sharper, and quicker than those of the latter, and in the
spring, before it sets out for its yet unascertained breeding-place, it
warbles very sweetly. It is called <i>Ammeskuk</i> by the Chinooks.”
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s notice respecting it is as follows:—“Of this bird,
whose manners so entirely resemble those of the Common Robin, we
know almost nothing. They probably breed as far north as Nootka,
where they were first seen by the naturalists of <span class="smcap">Cook</span>’s expedition. On the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_490' href='#Page_490'>490</a></span>
Columbia they are only winter birds of passage, arriving about October,
and continuing more or less frequently throughout the winter. At this
time they flit through the forest in small flocks, frequenting usually
low trees, on which they perch in perfect silence, and are at times very
timorous and difficult of approach, having all the shy sagacity of the
Robin, and appearing at all times in a very desultory manner.”
</p>

<p>
The numerous specimens of this Thrush in my possession have enabled
me to compare it with <i>Turdus migratorius</i>, and another new Thrush
from Chili. On examining the tail, from the shape of which Mr
<span class="smcap">Swainson</span> considers this species allied to our Mocking Bird, I found
its form, length, and extent beyond the wings, to correspond almost
exactly with those of the tail of our Robin; and, if it proves true that
the Varied Thrush forms a nest bedded with mud, it will strengthen
my opinion that both these and the Chilian species are as nearly allied
as possible, and therefore ought to be considered as true Thrushes, of
which, to assume the language of systematic writers, <i>Turdus migratorius</i>
is the type in America, whilst <i>Turdus Merula</i> is that of Europe.
</p>

<p>
The two figures in my plate were taken from adult males shot in
spring. You will find a figure of the female in Plate CCCCXXXIII.

<h2>
AMERICAN DIPPER.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Cinclus Americanus</i>, Swainson.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The specimens from which figures here given have been taken,
were procured on the Rocky Mountains, on the 15th of June, when
they were supposed to be breeding, so that they were probably adults
in full plumage. Having little taste for critical discussions, I shall
refrain from inflicting on the reader a long and elaborate review of all
that has been said on the subject of this interesting but little-known
bird, which was figured by the Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span> from a specimen
obtained near the sources of the Athabasca River, under the name of
<i>Cinclus Pallasii</i>; and has been described by Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>, first as
<i>C. Mexicanus</i>, and again, in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, as <i>C. Americanus</i>.
The latter name I prefer to that of <i>C. unicolor</i>, which is in fact
incorrect, the bird not being of one single colour. Unfortunately very
little is known respecting the habits of the American Dipper, which
however, being in form and size so very similar to that of Europe, probably
resembles it in its mode of life. I therefore cannot do better
than endeavour to supply the deficiency by presenting you with the
history of the latter species, as given in detail by my friend <span class="smcap">William
Macgillivray</span>, who, among the wild hills of his native country, has
studied its habits with a zeal and acuteness certainly not exceeded by
those of any ornithologist. His account, which first appeared in a periodical
named “The Naturalist,” and which he has revised and
amended for insertion here, is in truth a model of histories of this kind.
</p>

<p>
“The Dipper is in many respects one of the most interesting of
our native birds. Residing chiefly in the wild glens of the mountainous
districts, it now and then presents itself to the wandering naturalist
as it flits along the streams, or is seen perched on a stone in the
midst of the water, the white patch on its breast rendering it conspicuous
at a great distance. Even the mere collector of plants, who, of
all men, seems to be the least capable of comprehending the harmonies
of nature, pauses to gaze upon it, as it shoots past him in its rapid
and even flight; the solitary shepherd, wending his way to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_494' href='#Page_494'>494</a></span>
mountain corry, meets it with delight; and the patient and contemplative
angler, as he guides his tackle over the deep pool, smiles upon the
tiny fisher, whose frequent becks have attracted his notice. The singular
circumstance of its obtaining its food under the surface of the
water, although in form and structure it is allied to the Thrushes,
Wrens, and other land birds, has especially drawn the attention of ornithologists
to it; and the explanation of its mode of progression in
that element has exercised their ingenuity, although very few have
based their conjectures on actual observation. Lastly, the land-proprietor,
or his factor, too much occupied with other pursuits to inquire
for themselves, and trusting to the reports of prejudiced persons, direct
their gamekeepers and shepherds to destroy the lively and harmless
creature, whenever an opportunity occurs, because it has been supposed
to destroy the eggs and fry of the salmon.
</p>

<p>
“This bird having in a particular manner engaged my attention in
the course of my many rambles, I have been enabled to trace its history
in a satisfactory degree, so that the account here presented of it
I consider as among the most accurate of those which I have written.
</p>

<p>
“It frequents the sides of rivers and streams of inferior magnitude,
especially such as are clear and rapid, with pebbly or rocky margins.
I have met with it in every part of Scotland, as well as in the hilly
parts of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and it is said by <span class="smcap">Montagu</span>
to occur in Wales and Devonshire. In Scotland it is not peculiar to
the mountainous regions, being found in the lowest parts of the Lothians,
as well as on the alpine rills of the Grampians, and other elevated
tracts, but it is generally more abundant in hilly ground, and,
although never common in any district, is nowhere more plentiful than
on the Tweed and its tributaries, in the pastoral counties of Peebles
and Selkirk. It is also a well-known inhabitant of all the larger Hebrides.
It is not only a permanent resident, but seldom shifts its station
to any great extent, excepting during continued frosts, when it
descends along the streams, and is seen flitting about by the rapids and
falls. Mill-dams are also favourite resorts, especially in winter and
spring. On lakes having a muddy or peaty bottom I have never observed
it; but it may sometimes be seen on those which are shallow
and pebbly at the margins, as on St Mary’s Loch in Yarrow, where I
have shot it.
</p>

<p>
“The flight of the Dipper is steady, direct, and rapid, like that of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_495' href='#Page_495'>495</a></span>
Kingfisher, being effected by regularly timed and quick beats of the
wings, without intermissions or sailings. It perches on stones or projecting
crags by the sides of streams, or in the water, where it may be
seen frequently inclining the breast downwards, and jerking up the
tail, much in the manner of the Wheatear and Stonechat, and still
more of the Wren; its legs bent, its neck retracted, and its wings
slightly drooping. It plunges into the water, not dreading the force
of the current, dives, and makes its way beneath the surface, generally
moving against the stream, and often with surprising speed. It does
not, however, immerse itself head foremost from on high like the Kingfisher,
the Tern, or the Gannet; but either walks out into the water,
or alights upon its surface, and then plunges like an Auk or a Guillemot,
slightly opening its wings, and disappearing with an agility and
dexterity that indicate its proficiency in diving. I have seen it moving
under water in situations where I could observe it with certainty, and
I readily perceived that its actions were precisely similar to those of
the Divers, Mergansers, and Cormorants, which I have often watched
from an eminence, as they pursued the shoals of sand-eels along the
sandy shores of the Hebrides. It in fact flew, not merely using the
wing, from the carpal joint, but extending it considerably and employing
its whole extent, just as if advancing in the air. The general direction
of the body in these circumstances is obliquely downwards;
and great force is evidently used to counteract the effects of gravity,
the bird finding it difficult to keep itself at the bottom, and when it relaxes
its efforts coming to the surface like a cork. <span class="smcap">Montagu</span> has well
described the appearance which it presents under such circumstances:—“In
one or two instances, where we have been able to perceive it
under water, it appeared to tumble about in a very extraordinary manner,
with its head downwards, as if picking something; and at the
same time great exertion was used, both by the wings and legs.” This
tumbling, however, is observed only when it is engaged in a strong
current, and its appearance is greatly magnified by the unequal refraction
caused by the varying inequalities of the surface of the water.
When searching for food, it does not proceed to great distances under
water; but, alighting on some spot, sinks, and soon reappears in the
immediate neighbourhood, when it either dives again, or rises on wing
to drop somewhere else on the stream, or settle on a stone. Often
from a shelving crag or large stone it may be seen making short incursions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_496' href='#Page_496'>496</a></span>
into the water, running out with quiet activity, and presently
bobbing up to the surface, and regaining its perch by swimming or
wading. The assertion of its walking <i>in</i> the water, <i>on</i> the bottom,
which some persons have ventured, is not made good by observation,
nor countenanced by reason and the nature of things. The Dipper is
by no means a walking bird: even on land I have never seen it move
more than a few steps, which it accomplished by a kind of leaping
motion. Its short legs and curved claws are very ill adapted for running,
but admirably calculated for securing a steady footing on slippery
stones, whether above or beneath the surface of the water. Like
the Kingfisher, it often remains a long time perched on a stone, but in
most other respects its habits are very dissimilar.
</p>

<p>
“The first opportunity which I had of observing this bird advancing
under water occurred in Braemar, in 1819, when, from the bank of the
stream which passes by Castletown, I noticed one “tumbling about” in
the rapid current. In September 1832 I watched a Dipper for some
time, on a part of the Tweed, where the current was very rapid. It
flew off from the shore, and alighted in the middle of the stream, where
it immediately dived. Reappearing a little way farther up the river,
it floated for a few seconds, dived, emerged, and flew to the opposite
bank, on reaching which it again disappeared under water for a short
time, and thus continued its exertions. When perched on a stone near
the shore, especially if the water be not much agitated around, it
usually makes short incursions into it, apparently for the purpose of
procuring food, and returns to its station. On these occasions it is not
difficult to approach it, provided due precaution be used; but in general
it is shy and easily alarmed. I have several times shot at an individual
which observed me as I was quietly walking up to it; but it is not
often that one remains until you come within shot. A method which
I have often successfully practised was to mark the position of the bird
at a distance, taking note of an object on the bank opposite to it, then
make a circuit and suddenly come upon the spot. When one has been
pursued either up or down a stream for a quarter of a mile or so, it
usually turns, to regain its ordinary station, when it may be shot as it
dashes past.
</p>

<p>
“In August 1834, while ascending White Coom, the highest mountain
in Dumfriesshire, accompanied by my son, I observed a Dipper
retreating behind a large stone, over which the water fell, in the midst
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_497' href='#Page_497'>497</a></span>
of a streamlet that flowed along the bottom of a narrow sear or rut.
Imagining that its nest or young might be concealed there, we went
up to the place, and, on perceiving the bird behind the little waterfall,
endeavoured to catch it, on which it sallied forth, plunged into a pool,
and attempted to escape down the stream, but without success, for we
met it at every turn, and it was obliged to betake itself again to its retreat.
We now turned off the water from the stone, when it again
plunged into the pool, and after some windings, at length effected its
escape. On emerging at some distance it flew off, and I considered it
strange that it had not used its wings at first, as it certainly could more
easily have escaped through the air than through the water.  The
chase afforded another rare opportunity of viewing its subaqueous flight,
which in all probability was caused by excessive alarm. It flew about
in the pool, just as a bird would fly in a confined space in the air, but
of course, with less velocity, and on diving at first seemed covered with
small air-bubbles which adhered to its surface.
</p>

<p>
“On being wounded the Dipper commonly plunges into the water,
flies beneath its surface to the shore, and conceals itself among the
stones or under the bank. In fact, on all such occasions, if enough of
life remains, it is sure to hide itself, so that one requires to look sharply
after it. In this respect it greatly resembles the Common Gallinule.
In the winter of 1829, I shot one on the Almond, which flew to the
other side, walked deliberately out into the water, disappeared, and
slowly emerged under a bank at some distance, where I found it after
wading through the stream, which was partially frozen. Another had
just strength sufficient to fly into a deep hole under a bridge on the
Yarrow, partially filled with water, on which it was found floating dead.
In August 1834, I shot a Dipper on Manor Water in Tweeddale, which
flew off, dived, and hid itself under a bank, on which I forded the stream
and endeavoured to secure it, but it slipped out under water, swam
down the current twenty yards or so, and got under a large stone,
where it was traced. The introduction of the gun-rod only caused the
persecuted bird to retreat as far as it could, and when I was employed
in removing some pebbles and gravel from behind the stone, it slipped
out under water, and proceeded down the stream a considerable way
before it rose to breathe. I noticed the place where it dived in under
the bank, and it being at length obliged to come up to respire, I met
the bird with my hand and so secured it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_498' href='#Page_498'>498</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“When wounded and caught, it struggles hard, grasping firmly with
the feet, but does not attempt to bite. I mention this circumstance as
common to certain species of birds, such as the Fieldfare, Blackbird,
and Starling, which without possessing the power of annoying their
enemy, yet do not tamely suffer themselves to be destroyed, but struggle
to the last, undismayed, and ready to use the slightest chance of escape.
Other species, equal in strength, such as the Snipe, the Golden Plover,
and the Lapwing, do not struggle so vigorously, but meet their fate in
a quiet and apparently stupid manner. Some birds, again, such as the
Tits and Warblers, although evidently extremely frightened on being
seized, watch every opportunity of biting. I need scarcely add that
some, as the Kestril and Sparrowhawk, grasp and bite with as much
good-will as effect.
</p>

<p>
“The most melancholy ornithological exhibition that I remember to
have witnessed, was that of a wounded Dipper which was shot through
the lungs, above Cramond Bridge, near Edinburgh. It stood still, without
attempting to fly off, apparently insensible to all external objects,
its legs bent, its wings drooping, its head declined. The blood was
oozing from its side, and gurgling in its windpipe, which the poor bird
made ineffectual efforts to clear. At intervals, a convulsive heaving of
the chest took place, followed by an effort to vomit; and in that state
the sufferer stood for five minutes, until I got over the stream to it,
when it expired in my hand. In the agony of death, the pupil became
contracted to a mere point, and presently after dilated, when the lower
eyelid gradually rose and covered the eye. This is commonly the case
in birds, which do not expire with their eyes open, like man and most
quadrupeds.
</p>

<p>
“The food of the Dipper is said by authors to consist of small fishes,
roe, and water-insects. Thus, according to <span class="smcap">Willughby</span>, “<span lang="la">Pisces
predatur, nec insecta aversatur</span>.” <span class="smcap">Montagu</span> states that he saw an “old
bird flying in with a fish in its bill,” and that “these birds will sometimes
pick up insects at the edge of the water.” <span class="smcap">M. Temminck</span> alleges
that its food consists of “<span lang="fr">insectes d’eau, demoiselles et leurs larves;
souvent du frai de truite</span>.” Mr <span class="smcap">Selby</span> judiciously combines these statements,
informing us that “water-insects and the fry and spawn of fish
form its food.” Mr <span class="smcap">Jenyns</span>, more wary, confines it to “aquatic insects.”
It would answer no good purpose to bring forward the notions of other
compilers. There is nothing incredible in all these statements, although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_499' href='#Page_499'>499</a></span>
it is to be remarked that no one states that he has actually observed
fishes, or their eggs, in the stomach of this bird. I have opened
a great number of individuals, at all seasons of the year, but have never
found any other substances in the stomach than <i>Lymneæ</i>, <i>Ancyli</i>, Coleoptera,
and grains of gravel. As to the ova and fry of the salmon,
there is no evidence whatever that the Dipper ever swallows them;
and, therefore, the persecution to which this bird has been subjected
in consequence of the mere suspicion, ought to cease until the fact be
proved. That the mollusca above mentioned form a principal part of
its food was never suspected, and therefore I was much pleased with
making the discovery, which satisfactorily accounted to me for all the
subaqueous excursions of the species.
</p>

<p>
“The Dipper is generally seen in pairs, sometimes singly, and, for a
short period, at the breeding season, in families but never in flocks.
In some favourite places, such as a water-fall, or a series of rapids, one
may in winter find so many as four or five individuals, but always scattered.
Its song is short, but lively, and continued at intervals. It
bears no resemblance to the full song of the Thrushes, but closely resembles
the subdued winter warble of the Redwing and Starling, or
the first notes of a young Song Thrush. This gentle warble is not
confined to any period of the year, but may be heard during sunny
weather at all seasons. Its common note, which it frequently utters
while perched on a stone or while flying along the stream, resembles
the syllable <i>chit</i>.
</p>

<p>
“About the middle of spring it begins to form its nest, so that its
first brood is abroad at the same time with that of the Blackbird. The
nest, which is placed among the moss on the bank of a stream, or
among the roots of a tree in a concealed place overhanging the water,
sometimes in a crevice of a rock, or under a bridge, or even in the
space behind a waterfall, varies considerably in form and size, according
to its position; but is always very bulky, arched over, and resembles
that of the Wren more than of any other bird. A perfect specimen
found by my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Weir</span>, in the county of Linlithgow, presents
externally the appearance of a flattened elliptical mass, measuring
ten inches from the front to the back part, eight and a half in
breadth, and six in height. The aperture is in front, of a transversely
oblong form, three inches and a quarter wide, and one inch and a half
high. The exterior is composed of various species of mosses, chiefly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_500' href='#Page_500'>500</a></span>
hypna, firmly felted, so as to form a mass not easily torn asunder, especially
in its lower part. This portion may be considered as forming a
case for the nest properly so called, and in this respect resembles the
mud case of the swallows. The nest itself is hemispherical, five and a
half inches in diameter, composed of stems and leaves of grasses, and
very copiously lined with beech-leaves. I have examined several other
nests, which were similarly constructed, and all lined with beech-leaves,
one having a few of ivy, and another one or two of the plane,
intermixed. <span class="smcap">Montagu</span> describes the nest as “very large, formed of
moss and water plants externally, and lined with dry oak leaves”, and
others have stated that the lining is of leaves of various trees, which
may depend upon the locality. The eggs, five or six in number, are
of a regular oval form, rather pointed, pure white, varying from eleven-twelfths
to an inch and one-twelfth in length, and averaging nine-twelfths
in their greatest breadth. They are somewhat smaller than
those of the Song Thrush.
</p>

<p>
“The genus <i>Cinclus</i> may be considered as placed on the limits of the
families of Turdinæ and Myrmotherinæ, being in fact more allied to
<i>Turdus</i> than to <i>Pitta</i>, although through <i>Chamæza</i> perhaps more obviously
related to the latter. The digestive organs of the Common Dipper
are entirely analogous to those of the Thrushes and allied genera,
but bear no resemblance to those of the piscivorous birds, the œsophagus
being narrow, and the stomach a true gizzard. The bird, being
destined to feed upon aquatic insects and mollusca, which adhere to
the stones under the water, is fitted for making its way to the bottom
at small depths, and maintaining itself there for a short time, a minute
or more; in conformity with which design its plumage is rather short
and dense, its tail abbreviated, its wings short, broad, and strong, its
bill unencumbered by bristles, and of the proper form for seizing small
objects, as well as for detaching them from stones. Having its feet
constructed like those of the Thrushes, but proportionally stronger,
the Dipper thus forms a connecting link between the slender-billed
land birds and the diving palmipedes, as the Kingfisher seems to unite
them with the plunging birds of the same order.”
</p>

<p>
The only original observations respecting the habits of the American
Dipper that I have to present here are the following, with which
I have been favoured by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>:—“This bird inhabits the
clear mountain streams in the vicinity of the Columbia River. When
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_501' href='#Page_501'>501</a></span>
observed it was swimming among the rapids, occasionally flying for
short distances over the surface of the water, and then diving into it,
and reappearing after a long interval. Sometimes it will alight along
the margin, and jerk its tail upwards like a Wren. I did not hear it
utter any note. The stomach was found to contain fragments of fresh-water
snails. I observed that this bird did not alight on the surface
of the water, but dived immediately from the wing.”

<h2>
COCK OF THE PLAINS.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tetrao urophasianus.</i> Bonaparte.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXI. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Although the Cock of the Plains has long been known to exist
within the limits of the United States, the rugged and desolate nature
of the regions inhabited by it has hitherto limited our knowledge of
its habits to the cursory observations made by the few intrepid travellers,
who, urged by their zeal in the cause of science, have ventured to
explore the great ridge of mountains, that separate our western prairies
from the rich valleys bordering on the Pacific Ocean. Two of these
travellers, my friends Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> and Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, have favoured
me with the following particulars respecting this very remarkable species,
the history of which, not being myself personally acquainted with
it, I shall endeavour to complete by adding some notes of Mr <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Tetrao Urophasianus</i>, <i>Pi-imsh</i> of the Wallah Wallah Indians, <i>Mak-esh-too-yoo</i>
of the Nezpercee Indians, is first met with about fifty miles
west of the Black Hills. We lose sight of it in pursuing the route by
the Snake River until we reach Wallah Wallah, on the banks of the
Columbia, near the mouth of Lewis River. This bird is only found on
the plains which produce the worm-wood (<i>Artemisia</i>), on which plant
it feeds, in consequence of which the flesh is so bitter that it is rejected
as food. It is very unsuspicious, and easily approached, rarely flies
unless hard pressed, runs before you at the distance of a few feet,
clucking like the common Hen, often runs under the horses of travellers
when disturbed, rises very clumsily, but when once started flies
with rapidity to a great distance, and has the sailing motion of the
Pinnated Grous. In the autumn they frequent the branches of the
Columbia River, where they feed on a narrow-leaved plant. At this
time they are considered good food by the natives, who take great
quantities of them in nets. <span class="smcap">J. K. Townsend</span>.”
</p>

<p>
“On the north branch of the Platte (Larimie’s Fork) we begin to
meet with the <i>Tetrao Urophasianus</i> in considerable numbers, always on
the ground in small flocks or pairs, by no means shy, but when too
nearly approached arising with a strong whirring noise, and uttering at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_504' href='#Page_504'>504</a></span>
same time a rather loud but very short alarmed guttural cackle. The
notes of the female indeed at such times almost resemble those of a common
Hen. The old male when killed by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> turned out so different
from the imperfect and unadult specimens figured, that we could
scarcely recognise it for the same species. Its size seemed to promise
a fine meal, but appearances are often deceitful, and after being nicely
broiled, it truly deserved to be treated like the well-prepared plate
of cucumbers, proving so very bitter, though delicately white, that
our hungry hunters could scarcely swallow more than a morsel. In
short, it feeds by choice on the bitterest shrubs of these sterile plains,
and under-wood (several species of <i>Artemisia</i>) is literally its favourite
food. Of its nest and breeding habits we ascertained nothing,
but cannot for a moment hesitate to say that some mistake must exist
in either asserting or supposing that a bird so constantly confined to
the open desert plains, could retire to the shady forests and dark alluvial
thickets of the Columbia to rear its young apart from their usual
food and habits. We met with this very fine Grous near to the plains
around Wallah Wallah, on the south side of the Columbia, but never
saw it either in the forests of the Columbia or the Wahlamet, nor,
so far as we know, has it ever been found on the coast of California, or
in the interior of Mexico. <span class="smcap">T. Nuttall.</span>”
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>’s statement is as follows:—“The flight of these birds
is slow, unsteady, and affords but little amusement to the sportsman.
From the disproportionately small, convex, thin-quilled wing,—so thin
that a vacant space half as broad as a quill appears between each,—the
flight may be said to be a sort of fluttering, more than any thing
else: the bird giving two or three claps of the wings in quick succession,
at the same time hurriedly rising; then shooting or floating, swinging
from side to side, gradually falling, and thus producing a clapping,
whirring sound. When started, the voice is <i>cuck</i>, <i>cuck</i>, <i>cuck</i>, like the
Common Pheasant. They pair in March and April. Small eminences
on the banks of streams are the places usually selected for celebrating
the weddings, the time generally about sunrise. The wings of the
male are lowered, buzzing on the ground; the tail, spread like a fan,
somewhat erect; the bare yellow œsophagus inflated to a prodigious
size,—fully half as large as his body, and, from its soft, membranous
substance, being well contrasted with the scale-like feathers below it
on the breast, and the flexile, silky feathers on the neck, which on these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_505' href='#Page_505'>505</a></span>
occasions stand erect. In this grotesque form he displays, in the presence
of his intended mate, a variety of attitudes. His love-song is a
confused, grating, but not offensively disagreeable tone,—something
that we can imitate, but have a difficulty in expressing—<i>Hurr-hurr-hurr-r-r-r-hoo</i>,
ending in a deep, hollow tone, not unlike the sound
produced by blowing into a large reed. Nest on the ground, under
the shade of <i>Purshia</i> and <i>Artemisia</i>, or near streams, among <i>Phalaris
arundinacea</i>, carefully constructed of dry grass and slender twigs.
Eggs, from thirteen to seventeen, about the size of those of a common
fowl, of a wood-brown colour, with irregular chocolate blotches
on the thick end. Period of incubation twenty-one to twenty-two days.
The young leave the nest a few hours after they are hatched. In
the summer and autumn months these birds are seen in small troops,
and in winter and spring in flocks of several hundreds. Plentiful
throughout the barren, arid plains of the river Columbia; also in the
interior of North California. They do not exist on the banks of the
River Missouri; nor have they been seen in any place east of the
Rocky Mountains.”

Adult Male. Plate CCCLXXI. Fig. 1.
</p>

<p>
Bill shortish, strong, somewhat compressed; upper mandible with
the dorsal line arcuato-declinate, the ridge flattened at the base and
narrowed on account of the great extent of the nasal sinus, which is
feathered, the sides convex toward the end, the edges inflected, the tip
narrow and rounded; lower mandible with the angle of moderate length
and width, the dorsal line ascending and convex, the edges sharp and
inflected, the tip obtuse, but like the upper thin-edged. Head rather
small, oblong; neck of moderate length; body full. Feet rather short,
stout; tarsus roundish, feathered, bare and reticulated behind. Toes
of moderate size, covered above with numerous scutella, laterally pectinated
with slender projecting flattened scales; first toe small, second
a little shorter than fourth, third much longer. Claws stout, slightly
arched, moderately compressed, obtuse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_506' href='#Page_506'>506</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Plumage dense, soft, rather compact, the feathers in general broadly
ovate; those on the head very short, on the sides of the neck anteriorly
at its lower part and across the fore part of the breast, small, very short,
broad, stiff, and imbricated like scales; higher up on the sides of the
neck a tuft of feathers having their shafts elongated, bristle-like, and
terminated by a few filaments. On each side of the lower part of the
neck in front is a large bare space capable of being inflated into a
hemispherical sac. On the fore part of the breast the feathers, although
long, have the shaft thickened and elongated; the rest of the feathers
are of ordinary structure. Wings rather short, concave, much rounded,
the primaries stiff and very narrow, so as to leave a large interval when
the wing is extended; the third, fourth, and fifth quills longest. Tail
long, graduated, of twenty stiffish feathers, each tapering to a very
elongated point.

<p>
Bill black; iris light hazel; superciliary membrane vermilion; toes
brownish-grey; claws brownish-black. The upper parts are light yellowish-brown,
variegated with brownish-black and yellowish-white;
the feathers of the head and neck transversely barred, of the back
barred, undulated and dotted, with a whitish longitudinal line along
the shafts of the wing-feathers.  The quills chocolate-brown, their
outer webs and part of their inner margins mottled with yellowish-white.
Tail with about ten bands of yellowish-white on the outer webs,
which are otherwise variegated like the back, the inner webs nearly
plain brown. The throat and fore part of neck whitish, longitudinally
spotted with brownish-black; a narrow white band across the throat;
the sides of the neck and fore part of the breast white; the elongated
shafts of the tuft-feathers, black; the sides variegated like the back
with a broad line of white along the middle of each feather; the axillars
and lower wing-coverts pure white; the hind part of the breast
and the abdomen, brownish-black; the sides of the rump like the back,
the lower tail-coverts brownish-black, largely tipped with white, the
feathers of the tibiæ and tarsi pale brownish-grey, faintly barred with
brown.

<p>
The female is much smaller than the male, and differs in being destitute
of the bare skin on the fore neck, in having the superciliary
membranes smaller, the plumage entirely of ordinary texture; the
tail less elongated, with the feathers less narrow and ending in a
rounded point. All the upper parts, fore neck and sides are variegated

<p>
The size of this species has been exaggerated, it having been by
some compared to the Turkey, and by others to the Great Wood Grous
of Europe, <i>Tetrao Urogallus</i>, whereas, in fact, it seems not much to exceed
<i>Tetrao hybridus</i>. In some individuals, as I am informed by Dr
<span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, the hair-like shafts of the feathers on the sides of the neck,
are considerably longer than in my figure of the male.

<p>
The specimen from which the figure before you was taken, was
shot by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> on a rock near the Columbia River, on which
it had its nest. Unfortunately, however, he has not supplied me with
any account of this species, and the only notice respecting its habits
that I have seen, is that in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>:—“The
Common Buzzard arriving in the Fur Countries in
the middle of April very soon afterwards begins to build its nest; and,
having reared its young, departs about the end of September. It haunts
the low alluvial points of land which stretch out under the high banks
of a river; and may be observed sitting for a long time motionless on
the bough of a tree, watching patiently for some small quadruped, bird,
or reptile, to pass within its reach. As soon as it espies its prey, it
glides silently into the air, and, sweeping easily and rapidly down,
seizes it in its claws. When disturbed, it makes a short circuit, and
soon settles on another perch. It builds its nest on a tree, of short
sticks, lining it sparingly with deer’s hair. The eggs, from three to
five in number, are equal in size to those of the domestic fowl, and have
a greenish-white colour, with a few large dark brown blotches at the
thick end. It was seen by the Expedition as far north as the fifty-seventh
parallel of latitude, and it most probably has a still higher
range.”

the head and neck ovato-oblong, of the back and breast ovate and
rounded, of the sides and outer part of the leg elongated, of the rest
of the leg short. Wings long, broad, the fourth quill longest, the third
next, the fifth very little shorter, the second longer than fifth, the first
and seventh about equal; first four abruptly cut out on the inner web;
secondaries broad and rounded.  Tail rather long, broad, slightly
rounded.
</p>

<p>
Bill light blue at the base, with the margins yellowish, the tip
black; the cere yellow. Iris hazel. Feet yellow; claws black, at the
base bluish. The general colour of the upper parts is chocolate-brown.
The quills are of the general colour externally, but the primaries are
black toward the tip, a great part of the inner web, with the shaft,
white, and barred with brownish-black, the bars more extended on the
secondaries. The tail is marked with about ten dusky bars on a reddish-brown
ground, tinged with grey, the last dark bar broader, the tips
paler. The eyelids are whitish, as is the throat, which is longitudinally
streaked with dusky. The rest of the lower parts are yellowish
or brownish white, barred with brown. The lower wing-coverts are
white, barred or spotted with dusky; the white of the inner webs of
the primaries forms a conspicuous patch, contrasted with the greyish-black
of their terminal portion.

<p>
The Hare figured in the plate is thus described by my learned
friend Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, in his excellent observations on the different species
of the genus Lepus inhabiting the United States and Canada, inserted
in the seventh volume of the Journal of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia:—
</p>

<p>
“Smaller than the American Hare. Ears much shorter than the
head; eyes rather small; tail very short; feet small, thinly clothed
with hair. Upper surface yellowish-brown; beneath, grey.
</p>

<p>
“The upper incisors are longer and broader than those of the
American Hare, marked, like all the rest of the species, with a deep
longitudinal furrow. The small accessory incisors are smaller and less
flattened than those of the last mentioned species, and the molars are
narrower and a little shorter. The transverse diameter of the cranium
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_511' href='#Page_511'>511</a></span>
is much smaller, the vertical diameter about equal. Orbits of the eyes
one-third smaller. This is a striking peculiarity, giving it a smaller
and less prominent eye than that of any other American species. The
pterygoid processes of the temporal bone project downwards nearly in
a vertical line, whilst those of the American Hare are almost horizontal.
</p>

<p>
“Head and ears shorter than those of the <i>Lepus Americanus</i>; legs
short, and rather small; body short and thick; feet small, thinly
clothed with hair beneath, so as not to cover the nails, which are larger
than those of the American Hare. Tail shorter than that of any other
species of true hare inhabiting the United States, except the <i>Lepus
Nuttalli</i>. Hair on the back long and somewhat rough. From the
short legs and ears of this species, and its general clumsy habit, it has
the appearance when running through the marshes, splashing through
mud and mire, and plunging into creeks and ponds of water, of some
large Norway Rat, hastening to escape from its pursuers.
</p>

<p>
“The teeth are yellowish-white; the eyes are dark brown, appearing
in certain lights quite black. Upper parts of the head brown and
greyish-ash. Around the orbits of the eyes slightly fawn-coloured.
Whiskers black. Ears dark greyish-brown. The back and whole
upper parts yellowish-brown, intermixed with many strong black hairs.
The hairs, when examined singly, are bluish-grey at the roots, then
light brown, and are tipped with black. The fur, beneath, is light
plumbeous; under the chin grey; throat yellowish-brown; belly light
grey, the fur beneath bluish. Under surface of the tail ash-colour,
edged with brown. During winter the upper surface becomes considerably
darker than in summer.

“I have not heard of the existence of this small species of Hare to
the north of the State of South Carolina, nor is it found in the upper
parts of this State,—confining itself to the maritime districts, to low
marshy grounds partially inundated, to the borders of rivers subject to
the overflowing of their banks, and to the ponds, usually termed reserves,
where the waters intended to overflow the rice-fields are preserved.
In these situations, rendered almost inaccessible on account
of mud, entangled vines, and stagnant waters, sending up poisonous
miasmata, the fruitful source of disease, surrounded by frogs, water-snakes,
and alligators, this species resides through the whole year,
scarcely molested by man. In these forbidden retreats, frequented by
Herons (<i>Ardea</i>), Snake-birds (<i>Plotus Anhinga</i>), and Ibises, this almost
aquatic quadruped finds a home suited to its habits; making up for its
want of speed in eluding pursuit, by its facility in winding through
miry pools and marshes overgrown with rank weeds and willows. In
such situations, I have met with it fifty miles north of Charleston;
but, as soon as the traveller arrives at the high grounds of the middle
country, where the marshes disappear, this Hare is no longer seen. It
is common in all the lower parts of Georgia, and I have observed it
for sale in the market of Savannah. It is abundant in East Florida,
even at its farthest southern extremity. I received a living animal of
this species, taken on one of the islands near Indian Key, called Rabbit
Key, separated from the main-land by several miles of sea; where
it could have proceeded only by swimming, but where it is now found
in great numbers. In all the low grounds of Florida, this species takes
the place of the American Hare, which has not been observed in those
situations.
</p>

<p>
“The Marsh Hare is one of the most singular in its habits of all
the species. It runs low on the ground, and cannot be said to possess
the fine leaping gait of the American Hare. It is so slow of foot, that
nothing but the sheltered and miry situations in which it resides can
save it from being easily overtaken and captured. I have, indeed, observed
the domestics on a plantation, during a holiday, setting fire to
a piece of marsh ground, in a very dry season, and armed with clubs,
waiting till the flames drove these Hares from their retreats, when
they were run down and killed in considerable numbers, I noticed
that when the American Hare made its appearance it was suffered to
pass, on account of the speed they knew it to possess, but no sooner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_513' href='#Page_513'>513</a></span>
did the Marsh Hare appear, than with a whoop, they gave chase, and
seldom failed to overtake it.
</p>

<p>
“The feet of the Marsh Hare are admirably adapted to its aquatic
habits. A thick covering of hair on its soles, like that on the other
species, would be inconvenient; they would not only be kept wet for a
considerable length of time, but would retard them in swimming. All
quadrupeds that frequent the water, such as the Beaver, Otter, Muskrat,
Mink, &amp;c., and aquatic birds, have nearly naked palms; and it is
this peculiar structure, together with the facility of distending its toes,
that enables this quadruped to swim with such ease and rapidity. The
track, when observed in moist or muddy situations, differs very much
from that of the other species. Its toes are spread out, each leaving
a distinct impression, like those of the rat.
</p>

<p>
“The Marsh Hare deposits its young in a pretty large nest, composed
of a large species of rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) growing in a convenient
situation. These appeared to have been cut into pieces of
about a foot in length. I have seen these nests nearly surrounded by,
and almost floating on, the water. They were generally arched, by
carefully bending the rush-grass over them, admitting the mother by
a pretty large hole in the side. A considerable quantity of hair was
found lining the nest, but whether plucked out by the parent, or the effect
of the season, (it being late in spring when these animals shed
their coat) I was unable to ascertain. The young were from five to
seven. They evidently breed several times in the season, but I have
observed that the females usually produce their young two months
later, at least, than the American Hare. Twenty-one specimens were
obtained from the 9th to the 14th day of April; none of the females
had produced young that season, although some of them would have
done so in a very few days. On one occasion only, have I seen the
young in March. These bear a strong resemblance to the adults, and
may almost at a glance be distinguished from those of the last-mentioned
species.
</p>

<p>
“This species possesses a strong marshy smell at all times, even
when kept in confinement, and fed on the choicest food. Its flesh,
however, although dark, is fully equal, if not superior, to that of the
American Hare. The Marsh Hare never visits gardens or cultivated
fields, confining itself throughout the year to the marshes. It is occasionally
found in places overflown by salt or brackish water, but seems
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_514' href='#Page_514'>514</a></span>
to prefer fresh-water marshes, where its food can be most conveniently
obtained. It feeds on various grasses, gnaws off the twigs of the young
sassafras, and of the pond spice (<i>Laurus geniculata</i>). I  have seen many
places in the low grounds dug up, the foot-prints indicating that it was
the work of this species in search of roots. It frequently is found digging
for the bulbs of the wild potato (<i>Apios tuberosa</i>), as also for those
of a small species of Amaryllis (<i>Amaryllis Atamasco</i>).
</p>

<p>
“I possess a living animal of this species, which was sent me a
few weeks ago, having been captured when full grown. It became
so gentle in a few days that it freely took its food from the hand. It
is fed on turnip and cabbage leaves, but prefers bread to any other food
that has been offered to it. It is fond of lying for hours in a trough of
water, and seems restless and uneasy when the trough is removed,
scratching the sides of its tin cage until it has been replaced, when it
immediately plunges in, burying the greater part of its body in the
water.
</p>

<p>
“It has already shed a great portion of its summer, and resumed
its winter, dress. The hairs on the upper surface, instead of becoming
white at the point, as in the American Hare, have grown long and
black, through which the brownish parts beneath are still distinctly
visible.
</p>

<p>
“This species, like others of the genus existing in this country, as
well as in the deer and squirrels, is infested with a troublesome larva
of an œstrus in the summer and autumn, which, penetrating into the
flesh, and continually enlarging, causes pain to the animal, and renders
it lean. One of these larvæ dropped from an orifice in the throat of
the hare which I have in confinement. It was of the usual cylindrical
shape, but appears to differ in some particulars from the <i>Œstrus cuniculi</i>.”

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fringilla vespertina</i>, Cooper.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXIII. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
This fine species of Grosbeak was first introduced to the notice of
ornithologists by Mr <span class="smcap">William Cooper</span>, who published an account of it
in the Annals of the Lyceum of New York. Mr <span class="smcap">Schoolcraft</span> observed
a few individuals, in the beginning of April 1823, near the Sault Sainte
Marie in Michigan, from which the species was traced to the Rocky
Mountains. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> mentions it as a common inhabitant of
the maple groves on the Saskatchewan plains, whence “its native appellation
of Sugar-bird.” The female remained utterly unknown until
it was obtained by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, who found this Grosbeak abundant
about the Columbia River, and procured a great number of specimens,
several of which are in my possession. The following note from him
contains all the information respecting its habits that I can lay before
you.
</p>

<p>
“Columbia River, May 27, 1836.—The Evening Grosbeak, <i>Fringilla
vespertina</i>, is very numerous in the pine-woods at this time. You
can scarcely enter a grove of pines at any hour in the day without seeing
numbers of them. They are very unsuspicious and tame, and I
have, in consequence, been enabled to procure a fine suite of specimens.
The accounts that have been published respecting them by the only
two authors to whom I have access, Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> and Prince <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>,
are, I think, in many respects incorrect. In the first place, it
is stated that they are retiring and silent during the day, and sing only
on the approach of evening. Here they are remarkably noisy during
the whole of the day, from sunrise to sunset. They then retire quietly
to their roosts in the summits of the tall pines, and are not aroused
until daylight streaks the east, when they come forth to feed as before.
Thus I have observed them <i>here</i>, but will not say but that at other
seasons, and in other situations, their habits may be different. They
are now, however, very near the season of breeding, as the organs of
the specimens I have examined sufficiently indicate.  They appear
fond of going in large bodies, and it is rare to see one alone in a tree.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_516' href='#Page_516'>516</a></span>
They feed upon the seeds of the pine and other trees, alighting upon
large limbs, and proceeding by a succession of hops to the very extremities
of the branches. They eat, as well as seeds, a considerable
quantity of the larvæ of the large black ant, and it is probable that it
is to procure this food that they are not uncommonly seen in the tops
of the low oaks which here skirt the forests.  Their ordinary voice,
when they are engaged in procuring food, consists of a single rather
screaming note, which from its tone I at first supposed to be one of
alarm, but soon discovered my error. At other times, particularly about
mid-day, the male sometimes selects a lofty pine branch, and there attempts
a song; but it is a miserable failure, and he seems conscious of
it, for he frequently pauses and looks discontented, then remains silent
sometimes for some minutes, and tries it again, but with no better
success. The note is a single warbling call, exceedingly like the
early part of the Robin’s song, but not so sweet, and checked as though
the performer were out of breath. The song, if it may be so called,
is to me a most wearisome one: I am constantly listening to hear the
stave continued, and am as constantly disappointed. Another error of
the books is this,—they both state that the female is similar to the
male in plumage. Now, this is entirely a mistake: she is so very different
in colour and markings, that were it not for the size and colour
of the bill, and its peculiar physiognomy, one might be induced to suppose
it another species. The specimens in possession of Mr <span class="smcap">Leadbeater</span>
of London, and from which Prince <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span> drew up his
descriptions, must have been all males.”

<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The following account of this Grosbeak affords another proof of
the ardent zeal of my excellent friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, who, though
more especially engaged with botany on his recent journey to the Columbia,
has not neglected opportunities of noting many interesting facts
relative to birds.
</p>

<p>
“On the central table-land of the Rocky Mountains, and on the
upper branches of the Colorado of the west, we first heard the powerful
song of this most delightful Finch. From thence, in the thick
groves of all the streams on our western course to the borders of the
Columbia, and throughout the dense forests of that river nearly to the
sea, we were frequently cheered amidst the wildest desolation by the
inimitable voice of this melodious bird. Jealous of all intrusion on his
lonely and wild haunts, it was seldom that we had the opportunity of
witnessing this almost fairy musician, which gave a charm to the saddest
gloom, and made the very woods as it were re-echo to his untiring
song. With the modesty of superior merit, and almost with the solicitude
of the Nightingale, our favourite Finch seeks the darkest thicket
of the deepest forest. The moment his eye rests on the intruding observer
he flits off in haste, calls to his mate, and plunging into the
thicket sits in silence till he is satisfied of the restoration of solitude,
when he again cautiously mounts the twig and pours out afresh the oft-told
but never-tiring tale of his affection and devotion to the joys of
nature. His song, which greatly resembles that of the Red-breasted
Grosbeak, is heard at early dawn, and at intervals nearly to the close
of night. It is a loud, varied, high-toned and melodious fife, which
rises and falls in the sweetest cadence; but always, like the song of
the nightingale, leaves a sensation of pleasing sadness on the ear, which
fascinates more powerfully than the most cheering hilarity. In fact,
the closing note of our bird is often so querulous as to appear like the
shrill cry of appealing distress: it sinks at last so faintly, yet still so
charmingly on the sense.  When seen, which is only by accident, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_520' href='#Page_520'>520</a></span>
sits conspicuously on some lofty bough, below the summit of the tree,
and raising his head, and swelling his throat with a rising motion,
almost amounting to a flutter, he appears truly rapt in ecstacy, and seems
to enjoy his own powers of melody as much as the listener. Even the
cruel naturalist, ever eager to add another trophy to his favourite
science, feels arrested by his appeal, and connives at his escape from
the clutch of the collector.
</p>

<p>
“About the month of July, in the Rocky Mountains, I observed the
female feeding her fledged young, and they also spent the summer in
the thickest branches, but with the nest and eggs I am unacquainted.
The song, as I have heard it, in the forests of Columbia, seems to be
like the syllables <i>’tait</i>, <i>weet</i>, <i>teet</i>, <i>weowit</i>, <i>teet weowit</i>, <i>teet weeowit</i>, <i>verr</i>, and
sometimes terminating <i>weet</i>, <i>weet</i>, <i>weet</i>, every note a loud tender trill of
the utmost sweetness, delivered in his own “wood-notes wild,” mocking
nothing, but still exulting in his powers, which, while exerted, seem
to silence every songster around. The Robin seems almost his pupil
in song and similarity of expression, but falls short, and after our
Orpheus, seems at best but a faultering scholar.”

<h2>
SHARP-SHINNED OR SLATE-COLOURED HAWK.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Falco fuscus</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXIV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
There is a pleasure which that ornithologist only can feel who
spends his days in searching for the materials best adapted for his
purpose, and which arises from the contemplation of the objects he is
anxious to portray and describe, as they roam in freedom over Nature’s
wild domains. Another pleasure is derived from finding in different
countries birds so much alike in form, colour, and habits, that they
seem as if formed for the purpose of exercising our faculties of observation
and comparison. But this pleasure passes into pain, or at least
perplexity, when, as in the present instance, two species differ so
slightly that you cannot clearly define their characters, although they
yet seem to be distinct. In fact, I long felt uncertain whether the
American bird described by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> under the names of Sharp-shinned
Hawk, and Slate-coloured Hawk, was distinct from the Sparrow Hawk,
<i>F. Nisus</i>, of Europe.
</p>

<p>
It is mentioned in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, that a specimen
of this bird was killed in the vicinity of Moose Factory, and that it has
been deposited by the Hudson’s Bay Company in the Zoological Museum
of London. This specimen I have not seen, but confiding entirely
in the accuracy of every fact mentioned by the authors of that
work, I here adduce it as a proof of the extraordinary range of this
species in America, which from the extreme north extends to our
most southern limits, perhaps far beyond them, during its autumnal
and winter migrations. I have met with it in every State or Territory of
the Union that I have visited. In the spring of 1837, it was abundant
in Texas, where it appeared to be travelling eastward. I have a specimen
procured by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> in the neighbourhood of the Columbia
River; and, when on my way towards Labrador, I met with it plentifully
as far as the southern shores of the Gulf of St Lawrence, beyond
which, however, none were observed by me or any of my party.
</p>

<p>
I never saw this daring little marauder on wing without saying or
thinking “There goes the miniature of the Goshawk!” Indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_523' href='#Page_523'>523</a></span>
reader, the shortness of the wings of the Sharp-shinned Hawk, its long
tail, though almost perfectly even, instead of being rounded as in the
Goshawk, added to its irregular, swift, vigorous, varied, and yet often
undecided manner of flight, greatly protracted however on occasion,
have generally impressed upon me the idea alluded to. While in
search of prey, the Sharp-shinned Hawk passes over the country, now
at a moderate height, now close over the land, in so swift a manner
that, although your eye has marked it, you feel surprised that the very
next moment it has dashed off and is far away. In fact it is usually
seen when least expected, and almost always but for a few moments,
unless when it has procured some prey, and is engaged in feeding upon
it. The kind of vacillation or wavering with which it moves through
the air appears perfectly adapted to its wants, for it undoubtedly
enables this little warrior to watch and to see at a single quick glance
of its keen eyes every object, whether to the right or to the left, as it
pursues its course. It advances by sudden dashes, as if impetuosity of
movement was essential to its nature, and pounces upon or strikes such
objects as best suit its appetite; but so very suddenly that it appears
quite hopeless for any of them to try to escape. Many have been the
times, reader, when watching this vigilant, active, and industrious
bird, I have seen it plunge headlong among the briary patches of one
of our old fields, in defiance of all thorny obstacles, and, passing
through, emerge on the other side, bearing off with exultation in its
sharp claws a Sparrow or Finch, which it had surprised when at rest.
At other times I have seen two or three of these Hawks, acting in
concert, fly at a Golden-winged Woodpecker while alighted against
the bark of a tree, where it thought itself secure, but was suddenly
clutched by one of the Hawks throwing as it were its long legs forward
with the quickness of thought, protruding its sharp talons, and
thrusting them into the back of the devoted bird, while it was endeavouring
to elude the harassing attacks of another, by hopping and
twisting round the tree. Then down to the ground assailants and
assailed would fall, the Woodpecker still offering great resistance, until
a second Hawk would also seize upon it, and with claws deeply thrust
into its vitals, put an end to its life; when both the marauders would
at once commence their repast.
</p>

<p>
On several such occasions, I have felt much pleasure in rescuing
different species of birds from the grasp of the little tyrant, as whenever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_524' href='#Page_524'>524</a></span>
it seizes one too heavy to be carried off, it drops to the ground
with it, and being close by, I have forced it to desist from committing
further mischief, as it fears man quite as much as its poor quarry
dreads itself. One of these occurrences, which happened in the neighbourhood
of Charleston, in South Carolina, is thus related in my journal.
</p>

<p>
Whilst walking one delightful evening in autumn, along a fine
hedge-row formed by the luxuriant Rocky Mountain rose-bushes, I observed
a male of this species alighted in an upright position on the top-bar
of a fence opposite to me. I marked it with particular attention,
to see what might follow. The Hawk saw me as plainly as I did him,
and kept peeping now at me, and now at some part of the hedge opposite,
when suddenly, and with the swiftness of an arrow, it shot past
me, entered the briars, and the next instant was moving off with a
Brown Thrush, <i>Turdus rufus</i> in its talons. The Thrush, though seized
by the sharp claws of the marauder, seemed too heavy for him to carry
far, and I saw both falling to the ground. On running up, I observed
the anxiety of the Hawk as I approached, and twice saw it attempt to
rise on wing to carry off its prize; but it was unable to do so, and before
it could disengage itself I was able to secure both. The Thrush
must have been killed almost instantaneously, for, on examining it, I
found it quite dead.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>, Esq., tells us that in the “thinly
settled parts of the States of Georgia and Alabama, this Hawk seems
to abound, and proves extremely destructive to young chickens, a single
one having been known regularly to come every day until he had
carried away between twenty and thirty. At noon-day, while I was
conversing with a planter, one of these Hawks came down, and without
ceremony, or heeding the loud cries of the housewife, who most reluctantly
witnessed the robbery, snatched away a chicken before us.”
Again, while speaking of the wild and violent manner of this bird, he
adds “descending furiously and blindly upon its quarry, a young
Hawk of this species broke through the glass of the green-house, at
the Cambridge Botanic Garden; and fearlessly passing through a second
glass partition, he was only brought up by the third, and caught,
though little stunned by the effort. His wing-feathers were much
torn by the glass, and his flight in this way so impeded as to allow of
his being approached.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_525' href='#Page_525'>525</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Whilst travelling to some distance, the Sharp-shinned Hawk flies
high, though in a desultory manner, with irregular quick flappings of
the wings, and at times, as if to pause for a while and examine the objects
below, moves in short and unequal circles, after which it is seen
to descend rapidly, and then follow its course at the height of only a
few feet from the ground, visiting as it were every clump of low bushes
or briar patches likely to be supplied with the smaller birds, on which
it principally feeds. Again, after having satisfied its hunger, this
little warrior, at times rises to a great height, and indeed now and then
is scarcely discernible from the ground.
</p>

<p>
I found a nest of this Hawk in a hole of the well-known “Rock-in-cave”
on the Ohio River, in the early part of the spring of 1819. It
was simply constructed, having been formed of a few sticks and some
grasses carelessly interwoven, and placed about two feet from the entrance
of the hole. I had the good fortune to secure the female bird,
while she was sitting on her eggs, which were nearly hatched, and it
was from that individual that I made the figure in the plate. The
eggs, four in number, were almost equally rounded at both ends,
though somewhat elongated, and their ground colour was white, with
a livid tinge, scarcely discernible however amid the numerous markings
and blotches of reddish-chocolate with which they were irregularly
covered. The second opportunity which I had of seeing a nest of this
species occurred not far from Louisville in Kentucky, when I accidentally
observed one of these hawks dive into the hollow prong of a broken
branch of a sycamore overhanging the waters of the Ohio. Here
the eggs were five in number, and deposited on the mouldering fragments
of the decayed wood. The third and last opportunity happened
when I was on my way from Henderson to St Genevieve on horseback.
I saw a pair of these birds forming a nest in the forks of a low
oak, in a grove in the centre of the prairie which I was then crossing.
The young in the nest I have never seen.
</p>

<p>
This interesting species usually resorts to the fissures of rocks for
the purpose of there passing the hours of repose, and generally in places
by no means easy of access, such as precipitous declivities overhanging
some turbulent stream. It is often not until the darkness has so much
gained on the daylight as to render objects difficult to be distinguished,
that it betakes itself to its place of rest, and then I have only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_526' href='#Page_526'>526</a></span>
been assured of its arrival by the few cries which it utters on such occasions.
The earliness of its departure has often much puzzled me,
for with all my anxiety to witness it, I have never succeeded in doing
so, although on two or three occasions I have watched the spot more
than half an hour before dawn, and remained patiently waiting until
long after the sun had risen, when I clambered to the hole, and always
found it empty.
</p>

<p>
The food of this Hawk consists chiefly of birds of various sizes,
from the smallest of our warblers to the Passenger Pigeon or young
chickens, the latter appearing to afford a special temptation to it, as
has been above related. I am also aware that it feeds occasionally on
small reptiles and insects, and I shot the male represented in the plate,
on wing, whilst it held in its claws the small Shrew also represented.
It is extremely expert at seizing some of our smaller snakes and lizards,
and not unfrequently snatches up a frog while basking in the sun.
</p>

<p>
The difference of size observed between the males and females, as
well as between individuals of the same sex, is very remarkable; and
no doubt it was on account of this very great disparity that <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>
described specimens of both sexes as two distinct species. Its notes
are short, shrill, and repeated in a hurried manner, when the bird is
wounded and brought to the ground. It often emits cries of this kind
while falling, but suddenly becomes silent when it comes to the earth,
and then makes off swiftly, with long and light leaps, keeping silent
until approached. Although a small bird, it possesses considerable
muscular power, and its extremely sharp claws are apt to inflict severe
pain, should a person lay hold of it incautiously.

<p>
A male bird preserved in spirits presents
the following characters:—The roof
of the mouth is flat, with two longitudinal
ridges; the posterior aperture of the
nares oblong, with a linear anterior slit,
papillate on the edges. The tongue is 5
twelfths long, narrow, concave above,
slightly emarginate. The œsophagus,
<i>a b c d e</i>, is 3 inches 3 twelfths long; its
diameter at the upper part 5 twelfths; it
enlarges on the neck to a capacious crop,
<i>c d</i>, 1 inch in diameter. The proventriculus,
<i>e</i>, has a complete belt of small oblong
glandules. The stomach, <i>f g</i>, is
large, roundish, membranous, without distinct
muscles, 1 inch 3 twelfths long, and
1 inch broad. The intestine, <i>g h i l</i>, is
<span class="mixfract">14&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches long, its greatest diameter 2
twelfths. The rectum, <i>j l</i>, is 1 inch 9
twelfths long; its diameter at the anterior
part 3 twelfths; the cœca, <i>j</i>, are
exceedingly small, forming two scarcely
observable sacs, about half a twelfth in
depth. The trachea is <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inches long, its
rings unossified, 78 in number; the bronchi
long and slender, of about 18 half
rings. The contents of the crop and stomach
were portions of two small birds.
</p>

<p>
On comparing several specimens,
male and female, of this Sharp-shinned
Hawk, with others of the European Sparrow
Hawk, the proportions are found to
be similar, as are the colours of the upper parts; but the American
birds, especially the males, are much smaller; and the transverse bands
on the lower parts of the Sharp-shinned Hawk are redder and broader
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_530' href='#Page_530'>530</a></span>
than those of the Sparrow Hawk. The number of dark bands on
the tail is the same in both, namely four on the middle feathers, and
six on the lateral. The tail is not always precisely even, being in
both European and American birds often slightly rounded, the lateral
feather being sometimes a quarter of an inch shorter than the
longest.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A species most intimately allied to the Sharp-shinned Hawk presents
the same form and colours, but differs somewhat in its proportions,
and is much larger. The bill is much higher at the base, its upper
outline slopes from the commencement, and the festoon on its edge
is less prominent. The tarsi and toes are proportionally stronger, the
edge on the former not nearly so prominent. The first quill is a little
longer than the first secondary, the fifth quill (not the fourth) is longest;
and the tail is rounded, the lateral feather in a female being eight-twelfths
of an inch shorter than the longest. The dimensions of a female
of this species, shot by myself in South Carolina, are as follows:—
</p>

<p>
Length to end of tail <span class="mixfract">16&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches; wing from flexure 10; tail <span class="mixfract">7&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">10</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>;
bill along the ridge 1; tarsus <span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>; hind toe <span class="fract"><span class="fup">10</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, its claw 1; middle toe
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">8</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>, its claw <span class="fract"><span class="fup"><span class="mixfract">7&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span></span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is very probable that this is the <i>Accipiter Mexicanus</i> of Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span>,
whose brief account of a female of that species, in the Fauna Boreali-Americana,
agrees sufficiently with it. There are, however, some
errors in his critical observations, at p. 44. Thus, he states that <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s
figure of the Slate-coloured Hawk, <i>Accipiter Pennsylvanicus</i>, is perfectly
characteristic, in having the tail quite even at the end; but that
<span class="smcap">Temminck</span>’s <i><span lang="fr">Autour a bec sinueux</span></i> is doubtful, the tail being represented
as distinctly rounded. Now, in fact, the tail of our Sharp-shinned
Hawk is when perfect a little rounded, but often when worn quite
even or square. Both the figures in Plate CCCLXXIV represent it
as a little rounded, and such it is in five specimens out of eight, four
of these being females, and one a male; while the three specimens in
which the tail may be said to be quite even are males. Again, he
states that “the anterior scales on the tarsus of <i>A. Pennsylvanicus</i> are
entire, being apparently formed externally of one entire piece; whereas
in <i>Mexicanus</i>, the transverse divisions are distinctly visible.” The
latter part of the sentence is certainly correct, in so far as may be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_531' href='#Page_531'>531</a></span>
judged from a single very fine specimen; but the scales are equally
distinct in all the younger individuals of the <i>A. Pennsylvanicus</i>, although
in one, an old male, the distinctions between the greater number are
obliterated, so that they resemble a single plate. There is nothing
very remarkable in this, however, for the like happens to other Hawks;
it having been long ago remarked with regard to the Sparrow Hawk of
Europe, <i>Accipiter Nisus</i>, that “in some individuals, the anterior oblique
scutella, as well as the hexagonal scales of the sides, are so
indistinct, that all traces of them disappear when the parts become
dry.”
</p>

<p>
<i>Accipiter Nisus</i>, <i>A. velox</i>, and <i>A. Mexicanus</i>, which are most closely
allied, insomuch that it is extremely difficult to distinguish them from
each other, may be characterized as follows:—
</p>

<p>
<i>A. Mexicanus</i> is largest; has the fifth quill longest, the first primary
much longer than the last, the tail distinctly rounded, the tarsi stouter,
and with fifteen scales; the upper parts deep slate-blue; the lower
banded with light red and white.
</p>

<p>
<i>A. velox</i> is smallest, has the fourth quill longest, the first primary
much shorter than the last, the tail even, the tarsi extremely slender,
with fifteen scales; the colours exactly as in <i>Mexicanus</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>A. Nisus</i> is intermediate in size, never so small as <i>velox</i>, but sometimes
as large as <i>Mexicanus</i>, with the fourth quill longest, the first and
last primary about equal, the tail very slightly rounded or even, the
tarsi very slender, with eighteen scales, the upper parts deep slate-blue,
the lower narrowly banded with light red in the male, and dusky in the
female.
</p>

<p class="p2">
This species was described by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> under the name of Sharp-shinned
Hawk, <i>Falco velox</i>, and figured in Pl. XLV, a young female
only being represented, although a description is given of a young
male also. He afterwards figured an adult male (Pl. XLVI), and described
it under the name of Slate-coloured Hawk, <i>Falco Pennsylvanicus</i>,
considering it as a distinct species. It appears, however, that it
had previously been described under several names. Thus <i>Falco fuscus</i>
of <span class="smcap">Miller</span> and <span class="smcap">Gmelin</span>, and the American Brown Hawk of <span class="smcap">Latham</span>,
seem to be the same bird in the young state. <i>Falco dubius</i> of <span class="smcap">Gmelin</span>
and <span class="smcap">Latham</span>, the Dubious Falcon of the latter and of <span class="smcap">Pennant</span> are also
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_532' href='#Page_532'>532</a></span>
synonymous. The Dusky Falcon of <span class="smcap">Pennant</span> and <span class="smcap">Latham</span>, <i>Falco
obscurus</i> of the latter and of <span class="smcap">Gmelin</span>, may also belong to the same species.
If we consider priority of name as of paramount importance,
then, in so far as can be shewn, the species ought to be named the
“American Brown Hawk, <i>Falco fuscus</i>;” or, according to the newer
nomenclature, <i>Astur</i> or <i>Accipiter fuscus</i>. The names of “Sharp-shinned,”
“Slate-coloured,” and “<i>velox</i>” are not more distinctive; and <i>Pennsylvanicus</i>
is out of the question, having been applied to another
species.

<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
When I was in Labrador, my young companions and my son one
day (the 27th of July 1833) procured eight individuals of this species, of
different sexes and ages. Next morning I went to the place where
they had been shot, and found a good number remaining. The first
observation I made had reference to their notes, which, instead of resembling
those of the Goldfinch, as alleged by an American writer, are
very similar to those of the Siskin, and are frequently uttered both
when the birds are alighted and while they are on wing. They were
in small parties of seven or eight, apparently formed by the members
of the same family, and although several of these groups were around
me, they did not intermingle until fired at, when they all simultaneously
rose on wing, mixed together, and after performing several
short evolutions returned to the same bushes, separated into families, and
resumed their occupations. When alighted they were quite unsuspecting,
and so heedless as to allow a close approach, scarcely regarding
my presence, but clinging to the branches, dexterously picking out the
seeds of the alder-cones, and occasionally coming to the ground after
some which had dropped.
</p>

<p>
Few birds exhibit a more affectionate disposition than the Little
Redpoll, and it was pleasing to see several on a twig feeding each other
by passing a seed from bill to bill, one individual sometimes receiving
food from his two neighbours at the same time. Occasionally, however,
they shewed considerable pugnacity, and one would drive off its
companion, inflicting some smart blows upon it with its bill, and uttering
a low querulous chatter.
</p>

<p>
In other portions of the same country, I saw flocks composed of
twenty or more individuals flying loosely at a moderate height, in the
undulatory manner of the American Goldfinch and Siskin, without,
however, making the deep sweeps of the former; suddenly alighting,
and at once beginning to search with great expertness between the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_534' href='#Page_534'>534</a></span>
stems and leaves, picking at the embryo buds while perched over them,
like Jays and Titmice.
</p>

<p>
So hardy is this species, that, according to Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, it is a
“permanent resident in the Fur Countries, where it may be seen in
the coldest weather, on the banks of lakes and rivers, hopping among
the reeds and carices, or clinging to their stalks. Although numerous
throughout the year, even in the most northern districts, a partial migration
takes place, as large flocks visit Pennsylvania for a month or
two in severe winters.” The migrations alluded to are of rare occurrence
in that State, however, as well as in that of New York. I never
saw one of these birds to the westward of the Alleghanies, and none
were observed by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> or Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> on the Columbia
River. They are abundant every cold winter in the northern parts
of Massachusetts and Maine, as well as in all the British Provinces.
</p>

<p>
The food of this species consists of buds, seeds of various grasses,
berries, and the small leaves of bushes and trees. I have represented
a male and a female on a plant which grows abundantly in the localities
in which I found it in Labrador.
</p>

<p>
The many young birds which I examined in the month of August,
had the head entirely grey. The feathers of that part, and those on the
breast and rump, were of the same colour nearly to the base, which is bluish-grey;
and I suspect that they do not acquire any redness until the
approach of spring. The old birds were moulting at the period mentioned,
and from their appearance I concluded that all their red feathers
are reassumed each spring. The eggs, from four to six in number,
measure five-eighths in length, rather more than half an inch in diameter,
and are pale bluish-green sparingly dotted with reddish-brown
toward the larger end.

TRUMPETER SWAN.

<span class="smcap"><i>Cygnus Buccinator</i>, Richardson.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXVI. Young in Winter.</span>
</p>


<p>
The history of the American Swans has been but very slightly traced.
Few records of the habits of these majestic, elegant, and useful birds
exist, on which much reliance can be placed; their geographical range
still remains an unsolved problem; one species has been mistaken for
another, and this by ornithologists who are said to be of the first order.
The <i>Cygnus Bewickii</i> of Great Britain has been given as a North American
Swan in place of <i>Cygnus Americanus</i> (well described by Dr
<span class="smcap">Sharpless</span> of Philadelphia) in the Fauna Boreali-Americana; and
the latter bird has been taken for the Whistling Swan, <i>C. musicus</i> of
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>, by the Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>, who says in his Synopsis,
p. 379, No. 321, that it is “very numerous in winter in Chesapeake
Bay.” It is possible that we may have more than two species of Swan
within the limits of North America, but I am at present acquainted
with only that which forms the subject of this article, and the <i>Cygnus
Americanus</i> of <span class="smcap">Sharpless</span>.
</p>

<p>
In a note contained in the Journals of <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> and <span class="smcap">Clark</span>, written
in the course of the expedition of these daring travellers across the
Rocky Mountains, it is stated that “the Swans are of two kinds, the
large and small. The large Swan is the same with the one common
in the Atlantic States. The small differs from the large only in size
and note; it is about one-fourth less, and its note is entirely different.
These birds were first found below the great narrows of the Columbia,
near the Chilluckittequaw nation. They are very abundant in this
neighbourhood, and remained with the party all winter, and in number
they exceed those of the larger species in the proportion of five to
one.” These observations are partly correct and partly erroneous.
In fact, the smaller species of the two, which is the <i>C. Americanus</i> of
<span class="smcap">Sharpless</span>, is the only one abundant in the middle districts of our
Atlantic coast, while the larger Swan, the subject of this article, is
rarely if ever seen to the eastward of the mouths of the Mississippi.
A perfect specimen of the small Swan mentioned by <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> and <span class="smcap">Clark</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_537' href='#Page_537'>537</a></span>
has been transmitted to me from the Columbia River by Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>,
and I find it to correspond in every respect with the <i>C. Americanus</i> of
<span class="smcap">Sharpless</span>. Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> corroborates the observations of the two
eminent travellers by stating, that the latter species is much more numerous
than the large <i>C. Buccinator</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Trumpeter Swans make their appearance on the lower portions
of the waters of the Ohio about the end of October. They throw themselves
at once into the larger ponds or lakes at no great distance from
the river, giving a marked preference to those which are closely surrounded
by dense and tall cane-brakes, and there remain until the water
is closed by ice, when they are forced to proceed southward. During
mild winters I have seen Swans of this species in the ponds about
Henderson until the beginning of March, but only a few individuals,
which may have staid there to recover from their wounds. When the
cold became intense, most of those which visited the Ohio would remove
to the Mississippi, and proceed down that stream as the severity
of the weather increased, or return if it diminished; for it has appeared
to me, that neither very intense cold nor great heat suit them
so well as a medium temperature. I have traced the winter migrations
of this species as far southward as the Texas, where it is abundant
at times, and where I saw a pair of young ones in captivity, and
quite domesticated, that had been procured in the winter of 1836.
They were about two years old, and pure white, although of much
smaller size than even the younger one represented in the plate before
you, having perhaps been stinted in food, or having suffered from their
wounds, as both had been shot. The sound of their well-known notes
reminded me of the days of my youth, when I was half-yearly in the
company of birds of this species.
</p>

<p>
At New Orleans, where I made the drawing of the young bird here
given, the Trumpeters are frequently exposed for sale in the markets,
being procured on the ponds of the interior, and on the great lakes
leading to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. This species is unknown
to my friend, the Rev. <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, who, during a residence of
twenty years in South Carolina, never saw or heard of one there;
whereas in hard winters the <i>Cygnus Americanus</i> is not uncommon, although
it does not often proceed further southward than that State.
The waters of the Arkansas and its tributaries are annually supplied
with Trumpeter Swans, and the largest individual which I have examined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_538' href='#Page_538'>538</a></span>
was shot on a lake near the junction of that river with the Mississippi.
It measured nearly ten feet in alar extent, and weighed
above thirty-eight pounds. The quills, which I used in drawing the
feet and claws of many small birds, were so hard, and yet so elastic,
that the best steel-pen of the present day might have blushed, if it
could, to be compared with them.
</p>

<p>
Whilst encamped in the Tawapatee Bottom, when on a fur-trading
voyage, our keel-boat was hauled close under the eastern shore of the
Mississippi, and our valuables, for I then had a partner in trade, were
all disembarked. The party consisted of twelve or fourteen French
Canadians, all of whom were pretty good hunters; and as game was
in those days extremely abundant, the supply of Deer, Bear, Racoons,
and Opossums, far exceeded our demands.  Wild Turkeys, Grous,
and Pigeons, might have been seen hanging all around; and the ice-bound
lakes afforded an ample supply of excellent fish, which was procured
by striking a strong blow with an axe on the ice immediately
above the confined animal, and afterwards extricating it by cutting a
hole with the same instrument. The great stream was itself so firmly
frozen that we were daily in the habit of crossing it from shore to shore.
No sooner did the gloom of night become discernible through the grey
twilight, than the loud-sounding notes of hundreds of Trumpeters would
burst on the ear; and as I gazed over the ice-bound river, flocks after
flocks would be seen coming from afar and in various directions, and
alighting about the middle of the stream opposite to our encampment.
After pluming themselves awhile they would quietly drop their bodies
on the ice, and through the dim light I yet could observe the graceful
curve of their necks, as they gently turned them backwards, to allow
their heads to repose upon the softest and warmest of pillows.  Just a
dot of black as it were could be observed on the snowy mass, and that
dot was about half an inch of the base of the upper mandible, thus exposed,
as I think, to enable the bird to breathe with ease. Not a single
individual could I ever observe among them to act as a sentinel, and I
have since doubted whether their acute sense of hearing was not sufficient
to enable them to detect the approach of their enemies. The
day quite closed by darkness, no more could be seen until the next
dawn; but as often as the howlings of the numerous wolves that
prowled through the surrounding woods were heard, the clanging cries
of the Swans would fill the air. If the morning proved fair, the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_539' href='#Page_539'>539</a></span>
flocks would rise on their feet, trim their plumage, and as they started
with wings extended, as if, racing in rivalry, the pattering of their feet
would come on the ear like the noise of great muffled drums, accompanied
by the loud and clear sounds of their voice. On running fifty
yards or so to windward, they would all be on wing. If the weather
was thick, drizzly, and cold, or if there were indications of a fall of
snow, they would remain on the ice, walking, standing, or lying
down, until symptoms of better weather became apparent, when they
would all start off. One morning of this latter kind, our men formed
a plot against the Swans, and having separated into two parties, one
above, the other below them on the ice, they walked slowly, on a signal
being given from the camp, toward the unsuspecting birds. Until
the boatmen had arrived within a hundred and fifty yards of them, the
Swans remained as they were, having become, as it would appear, acquainted
with us, in consequence of our frequently crossing the ice; but
then they all rose on their feet, stretched their necks, shook their heads,
and manifested strong symptoms of apprehension. The gunners meanwhile
advanced, and one of the guns going off by accident, the Swans
were thrown into confusion, and scampering off in various directions
took to wing, some flying up, some down the stream, others making
directly toward the shores. The muskets now blazed, and about a
dozen were felled, some crippled, others quite dead. That evening
they alighted about a mile above the camp, and we never went after
them again. I have been at the killing of several of these Swans, and
I can assure you that unless you have a good gun well loaded with large
buck-shot, you may shoot at them without much effect, for they are
strong and tough birds.
</p>

<p>
To form a perfect conception of the beauty and elegance of these
Swans, you must observe them when they are not aware of your proximity,
and as they glide over the waters of some secluded inland pond.
On such occasions, the neck, which at other times is held stiffly upright,
moves in graceful curves, now bent forward, now inclined backwards
over the body. Now with an extended scooping movement the head
becomes immersed for a moment, and with a sudden effort a flood of
water is thrown over the back and wings, when it is seen rolling off in
sparkling globules, like so many large pearls. The bird then shakes
its wings, beats the water, and as if giddy with delight shoots away,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_540' href='#Page_540'>540</a></span>
gliding over and beneath the surface of the liquid element with surprising
agility and grace. Imagine, Reader, that a flock of fifty Swans
are thus sporting before you, as they have more than once been in my
sight, and you will feel, as I have felt, more happy and void of care
than I can describe.
</p>

<p>
When swimming unmolested the Swan shews the body buoyed up;
but when apprehensive of danger, it sinks considerably lower. If resting
and basking in the sunshine, it draws one foot expanded curiously
towards the back, and in that posture remains often for half an hour
at a time. When making off swiftly, the tarsal joint, or knee as it is
called, is seen about an inch above the water, which now in wavelets
passes over the lower part of the neck and along the sides of the body,
as it undulates on the planks of a vessel gliding with a gentle breeze.
Unless during the courting season, or while passing by its mate, I
never saw a swan with the wings raised and expanded, as it is alleged
they do, to profit by the breeze that may blow to assist their progress;
and yet I have pursued some in canoes to a considerable distance, and
that without overtaking them, or even obliging them to take to wing.
You, Reader, as well as all the world, have seen Swans labouring away
on foot, and therefore I will not trouble you with a description of their
mode of walking, especially as it is not much to be admired.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Trumpeter Swan is firm, at times greatly elevated
and sustained. It passes through the air by regular beats, in the same
manner as Geese, the neck stretched to its full length, as are the feet,
which project beyond the tail. When passing low, I have frequently
thought that I heard a rustling sound from the motion of the feathers
of their wings. If bound to a distant place, they form themselves in
angular lines, and probably the leader of the flock is one of the oldest
of the males; but of this I am not at all sure, as I have seen at the
head of a line a grey bird, which must have been a young one of that
year.
</p>

<p>
This Swan feeds principally by partially immersing the body and
extending the neck under water, in the manner of fresh-water Ducks
and some species of Geese, when the feet are often seen working in the
air, as if to aid in preserving the balance. Often however it resorts to
the land, and then picks at the herbage, not sidewise, as Geese do, but
more in the manner of Ducks and poultry. Its food consists of roots
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_541' href='#Page_541'>541</a></span>
of different vegetables, leaves, seeds, various aquatic insects, land
snails, small reptiles and quadrupeds. The flesh of a cygnet is pretty
good eating, but that of an old bird is dry and tough.
</p>

<p>
I kept a male alive upwards of two years, while I was residing at
Henderson in Kentucky. It had been slightly wounded in the tip of
the wing, and was caught after a long pursuit in a pond from which it
could not escape. Its size, weight, and strength rendered the task of
carrying it nearly two miles by no means easy; but as I knew that it
would please my wife and my then very young children, I persevered.
Cutting off the tip of the wounded wing, I turned it loose in the
garden. Although at first extremely shy, it gradually became accustomed
to the servants, who fed it abundantly, and at length proved so
gentle as to come to my wife’s call, to receive bread from her hand.
“Trumpeter,” us we named our bird, in accordance with the general
practice of those who were in the habit of shooting this species,
now assumed a character which until then had been unexpected, and
laying aside his timidity became so bold at times as to give chase to
my favourite Wild Turkey Cock, my dogs, children, and servants.
Whenever the gates of our yard happened to be opened, he would at
once make for the Ohio, and it was not without difficulty that he was
driven home again. On one occasion, he was absent a whole night,
and I thought he had fairly left us; but intimation came of his having
travelled to a pond not far distant. Accompanied by my miller and six
or seven of my servants, I betook myself to the pond, and there saw
our Swan swimming buoyantly about as if in defiance of us all. It was
not without a great deal of trouble that we at length succeeded in
driving it ashore. Pet birds, good Reader, no matter of what species
they are, seldom pass their lives in accordance with the wishes of their
possessors; in the course of a dark and rainy night, some of the servants
having left the gate open, Trumpeter made his escape, and was never
again heard of.
</p>

<p>
With the manners of this species during the breeding season, its
mode of constructing its nest, the number of its eggs, and the appearance
of its young, I am utterly unacquainted. The young bird represented
in the plate was shot near New Orleans, on the 16th of December
1822. A figure of the adult male you will find in Plate CCCCVI;
and should I ever have opportunities of studying the habits of this
noble bird, believe me I shall have much pleasure in laying before you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_542' href='#Page_542'>542</a></span>
the results. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that it “is the most common
Swan in the interior of the Fur Countries. It breeds as far south as
lat. 61°, but principally within the arctic circle, and in its migrations
generally precedes the Geese a few days.”
</p>

<p>
As the adult bird will be subsequently described, I judge it unnecessary
at present to enter into a full detail of the external form and
characters of the species, and will therefore confine myself to the colours
and proportions of the individual represented.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Aramus Scolopaceus</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXVIL Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
This very remarkable bird appears to be entirely confined to that
section of the Peninsula of Florida known by the name of “Ever-glades,”
and the swampy borders of the many bayous and lagoons
issuing from that great morass. Few are found farther north than
“Spring-garden Spring,” of which I have given you an account. I
have heard of its having been in one instance procured on one of the
Florida Keys, by Mr <span class="smcap">Titian Peale</span>, whose specimen, which was a
young male, has been described and figured in the continuation of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s
American Ornithology. None were seen by me on any of these
islands, and our worthy Pilot told me, that in the course of the many
years which he had spent in that country he had never met with one
off the main-land. It did not occur to me on any part of the coast,
while I was proceeding to the Texas, nor is it to be found in that country,
which seems very strange, when I look at this bird, and compare
it with the Rail family, which is so abundant along the whole of that
coast, and to which it is very nearly allied in some of its habits, more
especially to the Fresh-water Marsh Hen, <i>Rallus elegans</i>.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Scolopaceous Courlan is heavy and of short duration;
the concavity and shortness of its wings, together with the nature
of the places which it inhabits, probably rendering it slow to remove
from one spot to another on wing, it being in a manner confined
among tall plants, the roots of which are frequently under water. When
it rises spontaneously it passes through the air at a short distance above
the weeds, with regular beats of the wings, its neck extended to its full
length, and its long legs dangling beneath, until it suddenly drops to the
ground. Few birds then excel it in speed, as it proceeds, if pursued, by
long strides, quickly repeated, first in a direct course, along paths formed
by itself when passing and repassing from one place to another, and
afterwards diverging so as to ensure its safety even when chased by
the best dogs, or other not less eager enemies inhabiting the half-submersed
wilderness which it has chosen for its residence. When accidentally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_544' href='#Page_544'>544</a></span>
surprised, it rises obliquely out of its recess, with the neck
greatly bent downward, and although its legs dangle for a while, they
are afterwards extended behind in the manner of those of the Heron
tribe. At such times these birds are easily shot; but if they are only
wounded, it would be vain to pursue them. Although of considerable
size and weight, they are enabled, by the great length and expansion
of their toes to walk on the broad leaves of the larger species of Nymphæa
found in that country. They swim with the same buoyancy as
the Coots, Gallinules, and Rails.
</p>

<p>
The nest of this bird is placed among the larger tufts of the tallest
grasses that grow at short distances from the bayous, many of which
are influenced by the low tides of the Gulf. It is so well fastened to
the stems of the plants, in the same manner as that of <i>Rallus crepitans</i>,
as to be generally secure from inundation; and is composed of rank
weeds matted together, and forming a large mass, with a depression in
the centre. The eggs, which rarely exceed five or six, are large for
the size of the bird. The young are hatched early in May, and follow
their parents soon after birth, being covered with coarse tufty feathers,
of a black colour.
</p>

<p>
The Ever-glades abound with a species of large greenish snail, on
which these birds principally feed; and, from the great number of
empty shells which are found at the foot of the nest and around it,
it is probable that the sitting bird is supplied with food by her mate.
Their notes, when uttered while they are on wing, are a sort of cackle,
but when on the ground, much louder, especially during the pairing
season, or when they are started by the report of a gun. The flesh
of the young is pretty good eating. Although it is alleged that this
bird occasionally alights on trees, I have never seen it in such a situation.

<p class="p2">
This remarkable bird has exercised the ingenuity of the systematizing
ornithologists, some of whom have considered it as a Heron,
others a Crane, while many have made it a Rail, and many more a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_547' href='#Page_547'>547</a></span>
genus apart, but allied to the Rails, or to the Herons or to both. It
seems in truth to be a large Rail, with the wings and feet approaching
in form to those of the Herons; but while frivolous disputes might
be carried on <i>ad libitum</i> as to its location in the system of nature, were
we merely to consider its exterior; it is fortunate that we possess a
means of determining its character with certainty:—if we examine its
digestive organs, we shall at once see if it be a Rail, or a Heron, or
anything else. If a Heron, it will have a very wide œsophagus, a
roundish, thin-walled stomach, very slender intestines, and a single
short obtuse cœcum; if a Rail or Gallinule, or bird of that tribe, it will
have a narrow mouth, a narrow œsophagus, a very muscular stomach,
intestines of moderate width, and two moderately long, rather wide
cœca. Here then are two specimens, shot in Florida, and preserved in
spirits.
</p>

<p>
The first, which is found to be a female, has the mouth narrow,
measuring only 7 twelfths across; the tongue very long and extremely
slender, trigonal, pointed, extending to within half an inch of the tip
of the lower mandible, being <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inches in length. The œsophagus,
<i>a b c d</i>, which is 12 inches long, is narrow in its whole length, its diameter
at the upper part being 6 twelfths, below the middle of the neck 8
twelfths. The proventriculus, <i>b c</i>, is nearly 1 inch long, 9 twelfths in
its greatest diameter, bulbiform; its glandules cylindrical, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfth
long. Between the termination of the proventriculus, and the commencement
of the stomach, the space, <i>c d</i>, is more elongated than usual,
an inch and 2 twelfths, and presents the appearance of a tube curved
toward the left in the form of the letter S. The circular fibres of this
part are strong, and its epithelium is very thick, soft, and raised into
twelve very prominent rounded longitudinal rugæ. The stomach, properly
so called, <i>d e f g</i> is an extremely powerful gizzard, of an orbicular
form, compressed, with its axis a little inclined toward the right
side, its length 1 inch and 9 twelfths, its breadth 1 inch and 8 twelfths,
its thickness 11 twelfths. The left lateral muscle, <i>d f</i>, is much larger
than the right, occupying nearly one-half of the organ; the muscles are
thick, but not very remarkably so, their greatest thickness being 4
twelfths; the epithelium is very hard and rugous. The duodenum,
<i>g h i</i>, curves in the usual manner, folding back upon itself at the distance
of 3 inches. The intestine, <i>g h i j k</i>, is of moderate length, 31
inches, its greatest diameter 3 twelfths; the rectum, <i>k l</i>, 3 inches long,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_548' href='#Page_548'>548</a></span>
including the cloaca, <i>l m</i>, which is globular, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch in diameter; the
cœca, <i>n n</i>, of moderate size, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch long, for nearly half their length
2 twelfths in diameter, in the rest of their extent from 4 to 6 twelfths,
obtuse; their distance from the cloaca 10 twelfths.
</p>

<p>
The trachea, <i>o p</i>, is 10 inches long, narrow, of nearly uniform diameter,
being narrowest in the upper third of its length, unless for three-fourths
of an inch at the commencement. Its rings 186 in number, are
ossified, and a little flattened. The contractor muscles are slender,
as are the sterno-tracheal; and there is a single pair of inferior laryngeal.
The bronchi, <i>p q</i>, are wide, tapering, of about 15 narrow cartilaginous
half rings. The heart is of moderate size, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inch long, 1
inch in breadth. The liver is small, its lobes, which are equal, being
1 inch in length.
</p>

<p>
The other individual, a male, has the œsophagus 12 inches long;
the distance from the proventriculus to the stomach <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inch; the
stomach <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">8</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inch long, and the same in breadth; the cœca 2 inches
long, the greatest diameter 5 twelfths; the intestine <span class="mixfract">32&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches in
length, their greatest diameter <span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> twelfths.
</p>

<p>
Now, in all this there is nothing indicative of any affinity to the
Herons; the structure of the intestinal canal being essentially like
that of the Coots, Gallinules, and Rails. Even the external parts sufficiently
indicate its station, the bill; the plumage, and the colouring
being more like these of the Rallinæ than of any other family.
</p>

<p>
The Prince of <span class="smcap">Musignano</span>, who first described this bird as a Rail,
<i>Rallus giganteus</i>, afterwards adopted for it <span class="smcap">Vieillot</span>’s genus <i>Aramus</i>, and
considered it as belonging to the <i>Ardeidæ</i>, forming a connecting link
with them and the <i>Rallidæ</i> and “aberrating somewhat towards the
<i>Scolopacidæ</i>, as well as tending a little towards the <i>Psophidæ</i>, sub-family
<i>Gruinæ</i>” and claiming “again a well-founded resemblance to the
most typical form of the genus <i>Rallus</i>.” Finally, he reverts to his original
idea, and places it at the head of the <i>Rallidæ</i>. Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span> refers
it to the <i>Tantalidæ</i>, associating it with <i>Anastomus, Tantalus</i>, and
<i>Ibis</i>, to which it certainly has very little affinity in any point of view.
</p>

<p>
The efficiency of the digestive organs as a means of determining affinities
in cases of doubt, is happily illustrated in this instance; and any
person who will make himself acquainted with them will easily discover
numerous false associations in all systems founded on the external
aspect alone.

<p>
It is always disagreeable to an author to come forward when he has
little of importance to communicate to the reader, and on no occasion
have I felt more keenly than on the present, when introducing to your
notice an Owl, of which the habits, although unknown to me, must be
highly interesting, as it seems to assimilate in some degree to the diurnal
birds of prey. I have never seen it alive, and therefore can only
repeat what has been said by one who has. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> gives the
following account of it in the Fauna Boreali-Americana:—
</p>

<p>
“It is a common species throughout the Fur Countries from Hudson’s
Bay to the Pacific, and is more frequently killed than any other
by the hunters, which may be partly attributed to its boldness and its
habit of flying about by day. In the summer season it feeds principally
on mice and insects; but in the snow-clad regions which it frequents
in the winter, neither of these are to be procured, and it then
preys mostly on Ptarmigan. It is a constant attendant on the flocks
of Ptarmigan in their spring migrations to the northward. It builds
its nest on a tree, of sticks, grass, and feathers, and lays two white
eggs. When the hunters are shooting Grouse, this bird is occasionally
attracted by the report of the gun, and is often bold enough, on a bird
being killed, to pounce down upon it, though it may be unable from its
size to carry it off. It is also known to hover round the fires made by
the natives at night.”
</p>

<p>
I lately received a letter from my friend Dr <span class="smcap">Thomas M. Brewer</span>
of Boston, Massachusetts, in which he informs me that “the Hawk
Owl is very common at Memphramagog Lake in Vermont, where as many
as a dozen may be obtained by a good gunner in the course of a single
day. Its nests in the hollow trees are also frequently met with.” It
is surprising that none should have been seen by Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> or Dr
<span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, while crossing the Rocky Mountains, or on the Columbia
River; especially as it has been found by my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>,
Esq. as far southward on our eastern coast as New Jersey.

The specimens from which the figures in the plate were drawn,
were given to me by <span class="smcap">Thomas Macculloch</span>, Esq. of Pictou, who had a
good number of them. Two entire individuals preserved in spirits afford
materials for the following descriptions.

Plumage full, very soft, blended; the cere covered with slender
stiffish reversed feathers, having their filaments disunited; the facial
disks incomplete above. Wings rather long, rounded; the third primary
longest, the fourth one-twelfth and a half shorter, the second
four and a half twelfths shorter than the third, the first intermediate between
the fifth and sixth; the first four cut out on the outer web towards
the end, the barbs on the greater part of the outer web of the first,

<p>
Bill pale yellow; iris bright yellow; claws dusky. The facial disk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_552' href='#Page_552'>552</a></span>
is greyish-white, the shafts black, at its anterior part intermixed
with black filaments. The upper part of the head brownish-black,
closely spotted with white, there being generally three roundish spots
on each feather. The hind part of the neck is brownish-black, with
two broad longitudinal bands of white spots; a semicircle of brownish-black
feathers margins the facial disk behind. The general colour
of the upper parts is chocolate-brown, becoming lighter behind; all
the feathers marked with white spots in pairs, larger and more conspicuous
on the scapulars, disposed in bars on the rump and upper
tail-coverts. On both webs of the quills are several transversely elliptical
white spots, the outer webs of the first two and five inner primaries
excepted; the tips of all brownish-white. The tail is marked
with about eight transverse bars of white, formed by narrow oblong
alternating spots on both webs, the feathers also tipped with white,
the throat is greyish-dusky, that colour being succeeded by a semi-circular
band of white, beneath which is an obscure brownish-black
band; the rest of the lower parts transversely barred with dusky and
white; the dark bars of a deeper tint anteriorly, approaching to chestnut
on the sides and legs, fainter on the abdomen and feet, and greyish-brown
on the lower tail-coverts.

<h2>
RUFF-NECKED HUMMING BIRD.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Trochilus rufus</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXIX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
This charming Humming Bird was discovered by the great navigator,
Captain Cook, who found it abundant at Nootka Sound. It
does not appear to have been seen by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> or Mr <span class="smcap">Drummond</span>
in the northern parts of America, traversed by those most zealous
and highly talented naturalists. As no account has hitherto been given
of its habits, the following notices from my friends Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> and
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, will, I doubt not, prove highly interesting.
</p>

<p>
“We began,” says the first of-these enterprising travellers, “to meet
with this species near the Blue Mountains of the Columbia River, in
the autumn, as we proceeded to the west. These were all young birds,
and were not very easily distinguished from those of the common species
of the same age. We now for the first time (April 16.) saw the
males in numbers, darting, burring, and squeaking in the usual manner
of their tribe; but when engaged in collecting its accustomed sweets
in all the energy of life, it seemed like a breathing gem, or magic carbuncle
of glowing fire, stretching out its gorgeous ruff, as if to emulate
the sun itself in splendour. Towards the close of May, the females
were sitting, at which time the males were uncommonly quarrelsome
and vigilant, darting out at me as I approached the tree probably near
the nest, looking like an angry coal of brilliant fire, passing within
very little of my face, returning several times to the attack, sinking and
darting with the utmost velocity, at the same time uttering a curious
reverberating sharp bleat, somewhat similar to the quivering twang of
a dead twig, yet also so much like the real bleat of some small quadruped,
that for some time I searched the ground instead of the air, for
the actor in the scene. At other times, the males were seen darting
up high in the air, and whirling about each other in great anger, and
with much velocity. After these manœuvres the aggressor returned to
the same dead twig, where for days he regularly took his station with
all the courage and angry vigilance of a King-bird. The angry hissing
or bleating note of this species seems something like <i>wht’t’t’t’t sh vee</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_556' href='#Page_556'>556</a></span>
tremulously uttered as it whirls and sweeps through the air, like a
musket-ball, accompanied also by something like the whirr of the Night
Hawk. On the 29th of May, I found a nest of this species in a forked
branch of the Nootka Bramble, <i>Rubus Nutkanus</i>. The female was sitting
on two eggs, of the same shape and colour as those of the common
species. The nest also was perfectly similar, but somewhat deeper.
As I approached, the female came hovering round the nest, and soon
after, when all was still, she resumed her place contentedly.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>’s note is as follows:—“Nootka Sound Humming
Bird, <i>Trochilus rufus</i>, <i>Ah-puets-Rinne</i> of the Chinooks. On a clear day
the male may be seen to rise to a great height in the air, and descend
instantly near the earth, then mount again to the same altitude as at
first, performing in the evolution the half of a large circle. During the
descent it emits a strange and astonishingly loud note, which can be
compared to nothing but the rubbing together of the limbs of trees
during a high wind. I heard this singular note repeatedly last spring
and summer, but did not then discover to what it belonged. I did not
suppose it to be a bird at all, and least of all a Humming Bird. The
observer thinks it almost impossible that so small a creature can be
capable of producing so much sound. I have never observed this habit
upon a dull or cloudy day.”
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> having presented me with the nest of this species
attached to the twig to which the bird had fastened it, my amiable
friend Miss <span class="smcap">Martin</span> has figured it for me, as well as the plant, about
which these lovely creatures are represented. The nest, which measures
two inches and a quarter in height, and an inch and three quarters in
breadth, at the upper part, is composed externally of mosses, lichens,
and a few feathers, with slender fibrous roots interwoven, and lined
with fine cottony seed-down.

described, differing only in having the metallic spots on the throat
larger. A “young female, Columbia River, June 10th 1835,” differs
from the adult only in wanting the metallic spots on the throat, which
is spotted with greenish-brown.

was enabled to approach within a few feet of it, as it sat upon the
bushes. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> gives the following notice respecting it in
the Fauna Boreali-Americana:—“When it accidentally wanders abroad
in the day, it is so much dazzled by the light of the sun as to become
stupid, and it may then be easily caught by the hand. Its cry in the
night is a single melancholy note, repeated at intervals of a minute or
two. Mr <span class="smcap">Hutchins</span> informs us that it builds a nest of grass half-way
up a pine tree, and lays two white eggs in the month of May. It feeds
on mice and beetles. I cannot state the extent of its range, but believe
that it inhabits all the woody country from Great Slave Lake to
the United States. On the banks of the Saskatchewan it is so common
that its voice is heard almost every night by the traveller, wherever he
selects his bivouac.”

<h2>
SNOW GOOSE.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Anser hyperboreus</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXI. Adult Male and Young Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
The geographical range of the Snow Goose is very extensive.
It has been observed in numerous flocks, travelling northward, by the
members of the recent overland expeditions. On the other hand, I
have found it in the Texas, and it is very abundant on the Columbia
River, together with Hutchins’s Goose. In the latter part of autumn,
and during winter, I have met with it in every part of the United States
that I have visited.
</p>

<p>
While residing at Henderson on the Ohio, I never failed to watch
the arrival of this and other species in the ponds of the neighbourhood,
and generally found the young Snow Geese to make their appearance in
the beginning of October, and the adult or white birds about a fortnight
later. In like manner, when migrating northward, although the young
and the adult birds set out at the same time, they travel in separate
flocks, and, according to Captain Sir <span class="smcap">George Back</span>, continue to do so
even when proceeding to the higher northern latitudes of our continent.
It is not less curious that, during the whole of the winter, these Geese
remain equally divided, even if found in the same localities; and
although young and old are often seen to repose on the same sand-bar,
the flocks keep at as great a distance as possible.
</p>

<p>
The Snow Goose in the grey state of its plumage is very abundant
in winter, about the mouths of the Mississippi, as well as on all the
muddy and grassy shores of the bays and inlets of the Gulf of Mexico,
as far as the Texas, and probably still farther to the south-west. During
the rainy season, it betakes itself to the large prairies of Attacapas
and Oppellousas, and there young and adult procure their food together,
along with several species of Ducks, Herons, and Cranes, feeding, like
the latter, on the roots of plants, and nibbling the grasses sideways, in
the manner of the Common Tame Goose. In Louisiana I have not
unfrequently seen the adult birds feeding in wheat fields, when they
pluck up the plants entire.
</p>

<p>
When the young Snow Geese first arrive in Kentucky, about Henderson
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_563' href='#Page_563'>563</a></span>
for instance, they are unsuspicious, and therefore easily procured.
In a half-dry half-wet pond, running across a large tract of land, on the
other side of the river, in the State of Indiana, and which was once my
property, I was in the habit of shooting six or seven of a-day. This,
however, rendered the rest so wild, that the cunning of any “Red Skin”
might have been exercised without success upon them; and I was sorry
to find that they had the power of communicating their sense of danger
to the other flocks which arrived. On varying my operations however,
and persevering for some time, I found that even the wildest of them
now and then suffered; for having taken it into my head to catch them
in large traps, I tried this method, and several were procured before
the rest had learned to seize the tempting bait in a judicious manner.
</p>

<p>
The Snow Goose affords good eating when young and fat; but the
old Ganders are tough and stringy. Those that are procured along
the sea-shores, as they feed on shell-fish, fry and marine plants, have
a rank taste, which, however suited to the palate of the epicure, I never
could relish.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is strong and steady, and its migrations
over the United States are performed at a considerable elevation, by
regular flappings of the wings, and a disposition into lines similar to
that of other Geese.  It walks well, and with rather elevated steps;
but on land its appearance is not so graceful as that of our common
Canada Goose. Whilst with us they are much more silent than any
other of our species, rarely emitting any cries unless when pursued on
being wounded. They swim buoyantly, and, when pressed, with speed.
When attacked by the White-headed Eagle, or any other rapacious
bird, they dive well for a short space. At the least appearance of
danger, when they are on land, they at once come close together, shake
their heads and necks, move off in a contrary direction, very soon take
to wing, and fly to a considerable distance, but often return after a
time.
</p>

<p>
I am unable to inform you at what age the Snow Goose attains its
pure white plumage, as I have found that a judgment formed from individuals
kept in confinement is not to be depended upon. In one instance
at least, a friend of mine who had kept a bird of this species
four years, wrote to me that he was despairing of ever seeing it become
pure white. Two years after, he sent me much the same message;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_564' href='#Page_564'>564</a></span>
but, at the commencement of next spring, the Goose was a Snow
Goose, and the change had taken place in less than a month.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that, this species “breeds in the barren
grounds of Arctic America, in great numbers. The eggs of a
yellowish-white colour, and regularly ovate form, are a little larger
than those of the Eider Duck, their length being three inches, and
their greatest breadth two. The young fly in August, and by the
middle of September all have departed to the southward. The Snow
Goose feeds on rushes, insects, and in autumn on berries, particularly
those of the <i>Empetrum nigrum</i>. When well fed it is a very excellent
bird, far superior to the Canada Goose in juiciness and flavour. It is
said that the young do not attain the full plumage before their fourth
year, and until that period they appear to keep in separate flocks. They
are numerous at Albany Fort in the southern part of Hudson’s Bay,
where the old birds are rarely seen; and, on the other hand, the old
birds in their migrations visit York Factory in great abundance, but
are seldom accompanied by the young. The Snow Geese make their
appearance in spring a few days later than the Canada Geese, and pass
in large flocks both through the interior and on the coast.”
</p>

<p>
The young birds of this species begin to acquire their whiteness
about the head and neck after the first year, but the upper parts remain
of a dark bluish colour until the bird suddenly becomes white all
over; at least, this is the case with such as are kept in captivity. Although
it is allied to the White-fronted or Laughing Goose, <i>Anser albifrons</i>,
I was surprised to find that <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> had confounded the two
species together, and been of opinion that the Bean Goose also was the
same bird in an imperfect state of plumage. That excellent ornithologist
tells us that “this species, called on the sea-coast, the Red Goose,
arrives in the river Delaware, from the north, early in November,
sometimes in considerable flocks, and is extremely noisy, their notes
being shriller and more squeaking than those of the Canada, or common
Wild Goose. On their first arrival, they make but a short stay,
proceeding, as the depth of winter approaches, farther south; but from
the middle of February, until the breaking up of the ice in March,
they are frequently numerous along both shores of the Delaware, about
and below Reedy Island, particularly near Old Duck Creek, in the
State of Delaware. They feed on roots of the reeds there, which they
tear up like hogs.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_565' href='#Page_565'>565</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This species is rare both in Massachusetts and South Carolina, although
it passes over both these States in considerable numbers, and
in the latter some have been known to alight among the common domestic
Geese, and to have remained several days with them. My friend
Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, of Charleston, South Carolina, kept a male Snow Goose
several years along with his tame Geese. He had received it from a
friend while it was in its grey plumage, and the following spring it became
white. It had been procured in the autumn, and proved to be a
male. In a few days it became very gentle, and for several years it
mated with a common Goose; but the eggs produced by the latter
never hatched. The Snow Goose was in the habit of daily frequenting
a mill-pond in the vicinity, and returning regularly at night along
with the rest; but in the beginning of each spring it occasioned much
trouble.  It then continually raised its head and wings, and attempted
to fly off; but finding this impossible, it seemed anxious to perform its
long journey on foot, and it was several times overtaken and brought
back, after it had proceeded more than a mile, having crossed fences and
plantations in a direct course northward. This propensity cost it its
life: it had proceeded as far as the banks of the Cooper River, when
it was shot by a person who supposed it to be a wild bird.
</p>

<p>
In the latter part of the autumn of 1832, whilst I was walking with
my wife, in the neighbourhood of Boston in Massachusetts, I observed
on the road a young Snow Goose in a beautiful state of plumage, and
after making some inquiries, found its owner, who was a gardener. He
would not part with it for any price offered. Some weeks after, a
friend called one morning, and told me that this gardener had sent his
Snow Goose to town, and that it would be sold by auction that day.
I desired my friend to attend the sale, which he did; and before a few
hours had elapsed, the bird was in my possession, having been obtained
for 75 cents! We kept this Goose several months in a small yard at
the house where we boarded, along with the young of the Sand-hill
Crane, <i>Grus Americana</i>.  It was fed on leaves and thin stalks of cabbage,
bread, and other vegetable substances. When the spring approached,
it exhibited great restlessness, seeming anxious to remove
northward, as was the case with Dr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>’s bird. Although the
gardener had kept it four years, it was not white, but had the lower
part of the neck and the greater portion of the back, of a dark bluish
tint, as represented in the plate. It died before we left Boston, to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_566' href='#Page_566'>566</a></span>
great regret of my family, as I had anticipated the pleasure of presenting
it alive to my honoured and noble friend the <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of Derby.
</p>

<p>
There can be little doubt that this species breeds in its grey plumage,
when it is generally known by the name of Blue-winged Goose,
as is the case with the young of <i>Grus Americana</i>, formerly considered
as a distinct species, and named <i>Grus Canadensis</i>.

<p class="p2">
In an adult male preserved in spirits, the roof of the mouth is
moderately concave, with five series of strong conical papillæ directed
backwards. The posterior aperture of the nares is linear, margined
with two series of extremely slender papillæ. The marginal lamellæ
of the upper mandible are 25, of the lower about 45. The tongue is
2 inches 5 twelfths long, nearly cylindrical, with strong pointed papillæ
at the base, and on each side a series of flattened, sharp lamellæ, directed
backwards, together with very numerous bristle-like filaments.
It is fleshy, has a soft prominent pad at the base above, and towards
the end has a median groove, the point rounded thin, and horny. The
œsophagus; which is 17 inches long, has a diameter of 9 twelfths at the
upper part, and at the lower part of the neck is dilated to 1 inch. The
proventricular glands are cylindrical, simple, and arranged in a belt
nearly 1 inch in breadth. The other parts were removed.

<p>
The reddish tint on the head affords no indication of the age of the
bird, some individuals of all ages having that part pure white, while
others have it rusty. The same remark applies to our two Swans.

SHARP-TAILED GROUS.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tetrao Phasianellus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
This is another species of our birds with the habits of which I am
entirely unacquainted. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>’s account of it is as follows:—“The
northern limits of the range of the Sharp-tailed Grous is Great
Slave Lake, in the sixty-first parallel; and its most southern recorded
station is in latitude 41°, on the Missouri. It abounds on the outskirts
of the Saskatchewan plains, and is found throughout the woody districts
of the Fur Countries, haunting open glades or low thickets on the
borders of lakes, particularly in the neighbourhood of the trading paths,
where the forests have been partially cleared. In winter it perches
generally on trees, in summer is much on the ground; in both seasons
assembling in coveys of from ten to sixteen. Early in spring, a family
of these birds select a level spot, whereon they meet every morning,
and run round in a circle of fifteen or twenty feet in diameter, so that
the grass is worn quite bare. When any one approaches the circle,
the birds squat close to the ground, but in a short time stretch out their
necks to survey the intruder; and, if they are not scared by a nearer
advance, soon resume their circular course, some running to the right,
others to the left, meeting and crossing each other. These “Partridge
dances” last for a month or more, or until the hens begin to hatch.
When the Sharp-tailed Grous are put up, they rise with the usual whirring
noise, and alight again at the distance of a few hundred yards,
either on the ground, or on the upper branches of a tree. Before the
cock quits his perch, he utters repeatedly the cry of <i>cuck</i>, <i>cuck</i>, <i>cuck</i>.
In winter they roost in the snow like the Willow Grous, and they can
make their way through the loose wreaths with ease. They feed on
the buds and sprouts of the <i>Betula glandulosa</i>, of various willows, and
of the aspen and larch; and in autumn on berries. Mr <span class="smcap">Hutchins</span> says
that the hen lays thirteen white eggs with coloured spots early in June;
the nest being placed on the ground and formed of grass, lined with
feathers.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> informs me that while crossing the north branch of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_570' href='#Page_570'>570</a></span>
the Platte (Lorimie’s Fork), he found this species breeding, and that
as an article of food it proved to be a very well-flavoured and plump
bird, considerably superior to any of the other larger species that occur
in the United States.

Adult Male. Plate CCCLXXXII. Fig. 1.
</p>

<p>
Bill short, strong, as broad as high; upper mandible with the dorsal
line arcuato-declinate, the ridge narrow at the base on account of
the great extent of the nasal sinus, which is feathered, the sides convex
toward the end, the edges overlapping and thin, the tip declinate
and blunt, but thin-edged; lower mandible with the angle of moderate
length and width, the dorsal line ascending and convex, the edges sharp
and inclinate, the tip obtuse.
</p>

<p>
Head rather small, oblong; neck of moderate length; body full.
Feet rather short, stout; tarsus roundish, feathered, bare and reticulated
behind. Toes of moderate size, with numerous scutella above,
but covered over at the base by the hair-like feathers which grow from
the sides and the intervening basal membranes, laterally pectinate with
long slender projecting flattened scales; first toe small, second a little
longer than fourth, third much longer. Claws slender, arched, moderately
compressed, rather obtuse; that of the third toe with the inner
edge dilated.
</p>

<p>
Plumage dense, soft, rather compact, the feathers in general broadly
ovate; those on the head and upper part of the neck short, but some on
the upper and hind part of the former elongated and forming a slight crest.
There is a papillate coloured membrane over the eye, as in the other
species; and on each side of the neck is a large bare space, concealed
by the plumage, which I have no doubt is inflated, as in <i>Tetrao Cupido</i>
and <i>T. Urophasianus</i>, during the love season. Wings rather short,
concave, much rounded; the primaries stiff and very narrow, so as to
leave large intervals when the wing is extended; the third quill longest,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_571' href='#Page_571'>571</a></span>
the fourth next, the second shorter than the fifth, the sixth longer than
the first. Tail short, much graduated, of sixteen feathers, of which the
lateral are three inches shorter than the central; all the feathers are
more or less concave, excepting the two middle worn along the inner
edge, obliquely and abruptly terminated, the two middle projecting
an inch beyond the next.
</p>

<p>
Bill dusky above, brown beneath; iris light hazel; superciliary
membrane vermilion; toes brownish-grey, claws brownish-black. The
upper parts are variegated with light red or brownish-orange, brownish-black
and white; the black occupying the central part of the feathers,
the light red forming angular processes from the margin, generally
dotted with black, and a lighter bar near the end; the white being
in terminal, triangular, or guttiform spots on the scapulars and wing-coverts.
The alula, primary coverts, secondary coverts, and quills are
greyish-brown, the coverts spotted and tipped with white; the primaries
with white spots on the outer web, the inner tipped with white,
as are all the secondaries, of which the outer have two bars of white
spots, and the inner are coloured like the back. The tail is white, at
the base variegated, and the two middle feathers like the back. Loral
space, and a line behind the eye, white; a dusky streak beneath the
eye, succeeded by a light coloured one. The throat is reddish-white,
with some dusky spots; the fore part and sides of the neck barred with
dusky and reddish-white: on the lower part of the neck and fore
part of the breast, the dusky bars become first curved, and then arrow-shaped,
and so continue narrowing on the hind part of the breast, and
part of the sides, of which the upper portion is barred; the abdomen,
lower tail-coverts, axillar feathers, and most of the lower wing-coverts,
white. The hair-like feathers of the tarsi are light brownish-grey,
faintly barred with greyish-white.

<h2>
LONG-EARED OWL.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Strix otus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXIII.  Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
This Owl is much more abundant in our Middle and Eastern Atlantic
Districts than in the Southern or Western parts. My friend Dr
<span class="smcap">Bachman</span> has never observed it in South Carolina; nor have I met
with it in Louisiana, or any where on the Mississippi below the junction
of the Ohio. It is not very rare in the upper parts of Indiana, Illinois,
Ohio, and Kentucky, wherever the country is well wooded. In the
Barrens of Kentucky its predilection for woods is rendered apparent by
its not being found elsewhere than in the “Groves;” and it would seem
that it very rarely extends its search for food beyond the skirts of those
delightful retreats. In Pennsylvania, and elsewhere to the eastward, I
have found it most numerous on or near the banks of our numerous
clear mountain streams, where, during the day, it is not uncommon to
see it perched on the top of a low bush or fir. At such times it stands
with the body erect, but the tarsi bent and resting on a branch, as is
the manner of almost all our Owls. The head then seems the largest
part, the body being much more slender than it is usually represented.
Now and then it raises itself and stands with its legs and neck extended,
as if the better to mark the approach of an intruder. Its eyes,
which were closed when it was first observed, are opened on the least
noise, and it seems to squint at you in a most grotesque manner, although
it is not difficult to approach very near it. It rarely on such
occasions takes to wing, but throws itself into the thicket, and makes
off on foot by means of pretty long leaps.
</p>

<p>
I have never seen this bird moving on wing to a sufficient distance
to enable me to speak with certainty of its mode of flight, especially as
it is one of our most nocturnal species, seldom beginning to seek for
prey before it is quite dusky. In the morning I have never seen one
abroad at however early an hour I have been on the look-out.
</p>

<p>
The Long-eared Owl is careless as to the situation in which its
young are to be reared, and generally accommodates itself with an
abandoned nest of some other bird that proves of sufficient size, whether
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_573' href='#Page_573'>573</a></span>
it be high or low, in the fissure of a rock or on the ground.  Sometimes
however it makes a nest itself, and this I found to be the case
in one instance near the Juniatta River in Pennsylvania, where it was
composed of green twigs with the leaflets adhering, and lined with
fresh grass and sheep wool, but without feathers. The eggs are usually
four, nearly equally rounded at both ends, thin-shelled, smooth, when
newly deposited pure white, with a slight blush, which is no longer
observable when they have been for some time sitten upon, their average
length an inch and a half, their greatest breadth an inch and
three-sixteenths. I found eggs of this bird on the 15th of April, and
again on the 25th of June, which induces me to believe that it rears
two broods in the season in the State of Pennsylvania, as it probably
does also to the westward. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> relates the following instance of
its indifference as to the place selected for its eggs. “About six or
seven miles below Philadelphia, and not far from the Delaware, is a
low swamp, thickly covered with trees, and inundated during great
part of the year. This place is the resort of great numbers of the
Qua-bird or Night Raven (<i>Ardea Nycticorax</i>), where they build in
large companies. On the 25th of April, while wading among the dark
recesses of this place, observing the habits of these birds, I discovered
a Long-eared Owl, which had taken possession of one of their nests,
and was sitting; on mounting to the nest, I found it contained four
eggs, and breaking one of these, the young appeared almost ready to
leave the shell. There were numbers of the Qua-birds’ nests on the
adjoining trees all around, and one of them actually on the same tree.”
</p>

<p>
When encamped in the woods, I have frequently heard the notes
of this bird at night.  Its cry is prolonged and plaintive, though consisting
of not more than two or three notes repeated at intervals.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states that it has been found “as far north as Lat.
60°, and probably exists as high as the forests extend. It is plentiful in
the woods skirting the plains of the Saskatchewan, frequents the coast of
Hudson’s Bay only in the summer, and retires into the interior in the
winter. It resides all the year in the United States, and perhaps is
not a rare bird in any part of North America; but as it comes seldom
abroad in the day, fewer specimens are obtained of it than of the other
Owls. It preys chiefly on quadrupeds of the genus <i>Arvicola</i>, and in
summer destroys many beetles. It lays three or four roundish white
eggs, sometimes on the ground, at other times in the deserted nests of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_574' href='#Page_574'>574</a></span>
other birds in low bushes. Mr <span class="smcap">Hutchins</span> says it lays in April, and
that the young fly in May; and Mr <span class="smcap">Drummond</span> found a nest on the
ground in the same neighbourhood, containing three eggs, on the 5th
of July, and killed both the birds. On comparing the above-mentioned
eggs with those of the English Long-eared Owl, the American ones
proved to be smaller, measuring only an inch and a half in length, and
1.27 inches in breadth; while the English ones measured 1.8 inch in
length, and <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> in breadth. The form and colour were the same in
both.”
</p>

<p>
The food of this Owl consists of rats, mice, and other small quadrupeds,
as well as birds of various species; its stomach having been
found by me crammed with feathers and other remains of the latter.
</p>

<p>
There is a marked difference between the sexes. The males are
not only smaller than the females, but darker; and this has tempted
me to consider the <i>Strix Mexicanus</i> of Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span> and the Prince of
<span class="smcap">Musignano</span> as merely a large female of our Long-eared Owl.

<p>
Bill short, stout; upper mandible with its dorsal line slightly curved
from the base, towards the end decurved, the ridge broad at the base,
narrowed anteriorly, convex in its whole extent, the sides sloping at
the base, convex towards the tip, the edges soft and obtuse as far as the
nostrils, then sharp and barred to the end, below the nostrils inflected,
afterwards direct, the tip acute, and at its extremity descending obliquely;
the cere of moderate length, feathered on the sides; the lower
mandible straight, its angle elongated, wide, and rounded, the dorsal
line very short and slightly convex, the back and sides convex, the
edges toward the end sharp and inflected, their outline decurved and
with a slight sinus on each side, the tip obliquely truncate. Nostrils
medial, lateral, large, oblique, oblong, in the fore edge of the cere,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_575' href='#Page_575'>575</a></span>
with a tough soft membrane above, and having internally a ridge curved
backwards from the inner edge.
</p>

<p>
Head very large, flattened anteriorly; neck short; body very slender,
but seeming large on account of the great mass of plumage. Feet
of moderate length, and stout; tarsi feathered, short; toes also short,
and feathered; the third and fourth connected at the base by a short
web; the first shortest, and admitting of much lateral motion, the third
longest, the second and fourth nearly equal. On all the toes are two
terminal scutella. Claws long, curved in the fourth of a circle, tapering,
extremely acute, rounded above, very narrow beneath, the first
and second rounded, the rest flat; that of the fourth toe smallest, of
the first slightly larger, those of the other toes much larger and nearly
equal.
</p>

<p>
Plumage extremely soft and downy. The facial disks complete, and
composed of circular series of weak, slender, slightly recurved feathers,
having remote barbs; surrounding which is a ruff formed of several
rows of oblong incurved feathers, having the barbs close. The feathers
of the forehead are apparent between the ruffs, although that part is
very narrow; the bill is partially concealed by the plumage; the
feathers are oblong or ovate, and rounded, extremely soft, and blended,
those on the tarsi and toes, small, and somewhat silky. Wings long
and broad; primaries very broad, rounded, the outer a little incurved
towards the end, the first sinuate on the inner web near the end, the
second very slightly so; the second longest, the third a little shorter,
the fourth a little longer than the first; the outer in its whole length, the
second towards the end, and the first alular feather, with the barbs disunited
and recurved at the ends. Tail rather short, slightly convex,
a little rounded, of twelve broad rounded feathers, having feeble shafts.
</p>

<p>
Bill brownish-black, cere flesh-coloured; iris orange; claws bluish-grey,
dusky towards the end. The colouring of the plumage is very
intricate, but may be described as buff, mottled and spotted with brown
and greyish-white. The disks are whitish anteriorly, with the tips
black, posteriorly reddish-white; the ruff mottled with red and black;
the upper part of the head, minutely mottled with whitish, brownish-black,
and light red; the tufts light reddish toward the base, brownish-black
in the central part toward the end, the inner edge white, dotted
with dark-brown. The upper parts are buff, variegated with brown
and whitish-grey, minutely mottled or undulatingly barred. The first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_576' href='#Page_576'>576</a></span>
row of coverts tipped with white on the outer web; the edge of the
wing, and the outer margin of the first alular feather also white; the
alula and primary coverts greyish-brown barred with darker; the quills
and scapulars pale grey, barred with dark brown, and having more or
less buff towards the base of the outer web, that colour being conspicuous
on the six outer primaries. The tail is barred and mottled in
the same manner, the bars very narrow, ten on the middle and eight
on the outer feathers. The lower parts are in general similar to the
upper, but with more buff, and fewer spots, each feather with a long
dark brown streak and several irregular transverse bars. The legs
and toes are pure buff. The lower surface of the wing is yellowish-white,
a few of the coverts with a brown spot; the quills banded with
brown towards the end. The lower tail-coverts have a narrow central
brown line.

<h2>
BLACK-THROATED BUNTING.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Emberiza Americana</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXIV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Although this handsome Bunting may be said to be abundant
in our middle Atlantic districts, it is there much less so than in the
vast prairies of the south-west; and I consider those of the Texas to
afford the localities best adapted to its habits. There, as my companions
and I were returning from the capital of the infant republic,
Houston, we were surprised to see how very numerous the Black-throated
Buntings were in every open piece of ground covered by
tufts of tall grass. They are also abundant on the open lands of
Missouri and Illinois: but rarer in Ohio, and scarce in Kentucky.
They are rarely observed to pass over South Carolina, but in Pennsylvania
they are plentiful, and there breed in every field covered with
grass or grain. I have also met with them in Massachusetts, but
beyond this they are not seen to the eastward.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of the period of their removal from our Middle
States southward, the Black-throated Buntings congregate in particular
localities, as if to consult regarding their future proceedings. At
this season I once went from Philadelphia in search of them, accompanied
by my friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, and my son <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>.
Having reached Salem in New Jersey, we rambled some time in the
neighbourhood, and found an elevated piece of ground, closely covered
with high rank weeds, among which a great number of these birds
had assembled. It being late in July, the males were moulting, or
had already acquired their new plumage; the young, although full
grown, had not yet assumed their second clothing, in which the sexes
are distinguished; and the females were generally ragged. The birds
were at first quite gentle, but after we had fired a few times they all
flew off to a considerable distance, from which, however, they soon
returned. On our continuing to harass them, however, they rose high
in the air, and flew out of our sight in a southward direction. They
had then undoubtedly begun migrating. These birds are very partial
to particular localities. Sandy soil, unmixed with clay or earth, is not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_580' href='#Page_580'>580</a></span>
favourable to them; and it is probably for this reason that none are
found in any purely sandy part of the State of New Jersey.
</p>

<p>
The Black-throated Buntings reach our Middle States about the
10th or 15th of May, and at once betake themselves to the dry meadow
lands and grain fields, where they soon after begin to breed. The
males are often observed perched on the top branches of the shade
trees found in those places, and engaged in delighting their mates with
their simple ditty, which, according to my learned friend Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>,
resembles <i>’tic ’tic-tshĕ tshĕ tshĕ tshe</i>, and <i>tship tship</i>, <i>tschĕ tschĕ tschĕ tschip</i>.
To my ears the notes of our Black-throated Bunting so much resemble
those of the Corn Bunting of Europe, <i>Emberiza Miliaria</i>, that I have
often been reminded of the one by hearing the song of the other. These
unmusical notes are almost continuously uttered from sunrise to sunset,
and all this while the female is snugly seated on her eggs, and listening
to her beloved. He often visits her, alighting within a few
yards of where she is concealed, and then cautiously proceeding toward
the spot on foot, through the grass. When the bird leaves the nest, it
creeps along to some distance, and then flies off low over the ground.
</p>

<p>
About the first of June the nest is formed. It is constructed of
fine grass neatly woven in a circular form, and is partly imbedded
in the soil, and sheltered or concealed by a tuft of herbage. The
eggs, usually five, are six and a half eighths in length, four and three-fourths
in breadth, of a sullied white, generally sprinkled with faint
touches of different tints of umber. In Pennsylvania, it seldom rears
more than one brood in the season; but in the Texas, I have reason to
believe that it raises two.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this bird, when it has settled in a place, is usually of
short extent. The male, while passing to and fro from the nest, exhibits
a quivering motion of the wings. The female seldom shews this,
unless when her property is in danger from intruders. While travelling,
which they always do by day, they pass high over the trees, in
flocks of thirty or forty, which suddenly alight at the approach of night,
and throw themselves into the most thickly-leaved trees, where they
repose until dawn. I have surprised them in such situations both in
Kentucky and in Louisiana, and on shooting into the place to which
they had betaken themselves, although I could not see them, have procured
several at one discharge; which proved in one instance to be
males, and in the other females, thus shewing that the sexes travel separately. 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_581' href='#Page_581'>581</a></span>
On such occasions, the survivors would sally forth, make a
few rapid evolutions, and alight on the same tree.
</p>

<p>
In spring, I have found them, on two or three occasions, near Natchez,
in the State of Mississippi, in meadows, in company with Bob-o-links,
<i>Emberiza Oryzivora</i>. On the ground they leap or hop, but never
walk. Their flesh is good, especially that of the young birds.

In its habits, this bird closely resembles the
Common or Corn Bunting of Europe, its flight and
notes being almost the same. Like it, our bird
alights on walls, fences, detached rocks, or eminences
of any kind, where it is often seen even in the
immediate neighbourhood of our cities. Indeed, I
have found it in full song perched on the trees that
ornament the squares of Washington city. In the
form of its bill it also agrees with the Buntings, although that organ is
proportionally longer and less attenuated toward the end. If, on the
principle of minute division, it is not admitted into the genus <i>Emberiza</i>,
it must at least occupy a place in its immediate proximity.

The plants represented are the <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i> and <i>Antirrhinum

difficult to be extirpated.

<h2>
BANK SWALLOW OR SAND MARTIN.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Hirundo riparia</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXV. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>


<p>
Imagine, Reader, how delighted I was when, in East Florida, in
the winter of 1831, I found thousands of Bank Swallows gaily skimming
over the waters, and along the shores of the rivers and inlets. So
numerous indeed were they that I felt inclined to think that the greater
part of those which are in summer dispersed over the United States,
and the regions still farther north, must have congregated to form those
vast swarms. The first time I saw them was before sunrise, when I
stood by the side of Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Percy</span> of our Navy, on the deck of the
United States’ schooner the Spark, then at anchor opposite St Augustine.
The weather though warm, was thick and drizzly, so that we
could not see to a great distance; but as probably some hundreds of
thousands passed close to the vessel, in long and rather close flocks, I
was well enabled to assure myself that the birds were of this species.
On my expressing my surprise and delight at beholding so vast a concourse,
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Percy</span> assured me, that he had seen them on all
the streams which he had visited south of where we then were. The
weather cleared up in a few hours, the sun shone brightly, and the
little creatures were seen all around, dipping into the water to wash
themselves, gambolling close over its surface, and busily engaged in
procuring insects, which in that country are always abundant. In the
course of the same season I also observed a good number of our Green-backed
and Barn Swallows, but few compared with what is seen about
New Orleans.
</p>

<p>
We can thus account for the early appearance of the Bank Swallows
in our Middle Districts. That species always arrives there sooner
than the rest, sometimes preceding them by a fortnight, and keeping
equally in advance as far northward as its range extends. The Green-backed
Swallow, <i>Hirundo bicolor</i>, follows closely after it; then the Purple
Martin, <i>Hirundo purpurea</i>; after which are seen the Barn Swallow,
<i>Hirundo rustica</i>, and lastly, on our eastern Atlantic coasts, the American
Swift, <i>Cypselus Americanus</i>. It is probable that these species extend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_585' href='#Page_585'>585</a></span>
their autumnal migrations southward in a degree proportionate to the
lateness of their appearance in Spring. I have likewise observed the
arrival of the Bank Swallows on the waters of the Serpentine River and
those of the Regent’s Park, in London, to be in the same proportion
earlier than that of the other species which visit England in spring,
and have thought that, as with us, the first mentioned species retires to
a less distance in winter than the rest.
</p>

<p>
The Bank Swallow has been observed on both sides of North America,
and in all intermediate places suited to its habits. This is easily
accounted for, when we reflect how easy it is for these birds to follow
our great water-courses to their very sources. Even the ponds and
lakes of our vast forests are at times visited by them; but no person
seems to have been aware of the existence of two species of Bank Swallows
in our country, which, however, I shall presently shew to be the
case.
</p>

<p>
Wherever, throughout the United States, sand-banks or artificial
excavations occur, there is found the Bank Swallow during the breeding
season, in greater or smaller numbers, according to the advantages
presented by the different localities, not only along the shores of our
rivers and lakes, but also on the coasts of the Atlantic, and not unfrequently
in inland situations, at some distance from any water. High
banks, composed of softish sandy earth, on the shores of rivers, lakes,
or other waters, suit them best, and in such situations their colonies
are far more numerous than elsewhere. The banks of the Ohio, and
some parts of those of the Mississippi, called “Bluffs” have appeared
to me to be more resorted to by this species in our western and southern
districts, although I have met with considerable numbers in every
State of the Union.
</p>

<p>
In Louisiana this species begins to breed early in March, and generally
rears two, sometimes three broods in a season. In our Middle
Districts it commences about a month later, or about the period at which
it lays in Kentucky, and there produces two broods. In Newfoundland
and Labrador, it rarely begins to breed before the beginning of June,
and lays only once. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states, that he saw “thousands
of these Swallows near the mouth of the Mackenzie, in the sixty-eighth
parallel, on the 4th of July,” and from the state of the weather at that
period supposed that they had arrived there at least a fortnight prior
to that date, but no specimens were brought to England, and the description
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_586' href='#Page_586'>586</a></span>
given in the Fauna Boreali-Americana is a mere transcript of
that which in itself is quite imperfect. Indeed, there is not in any work
with which I am acquainted an account of the Sand Swallow, sufficiently
minute and accurate to characterize in an adequate manner
that very common species.
</p>

<p>
The sociability and gentleness of these birds, the lightness and vigour
with which they perform their various evolutions, the low and unobtrusive
twittering of their voice, in short, all their actions and economy,
are delightful to contemplate. Their flight is exceedingly graceful,
light, yet firm, and capable of great continuance. They seem indeed
as if created for the purpose of spending their time on wing, for they alight
less often to rest when full grown than any other of our species, when
not sitting on their eggs, and are seen abroad searching for food later
in the dusk, retiring for the night as late, I think, as our Swift, <i>Cypselus
Americanus</i>. As they procure their food more commonly than the
other species along the margins or over the surface of pools, lakes, rivers,
or even the sea, their flight is generally performed at a small elevation,
which is the case with others only when the wind blows smartly,
or the atmosphere is damp and chill. The movements of their wings
are those common to the family of Swallows, which flap these members
less frequently than perhaps any other small land birds. The wings
act on the hinge formed by the carpal joint, opening and closing like
the blades of scissors. Their sailings, though frequent, are not extensive,
and their tail appears to be of great service to them, as you observe
that on the least deviation from a straight course, it becomes
suddenly more or less closed or inclined upward, downward, or sideways;
and when you see some hundreds of pairs about their breeding
places, passing, repassing, and crossing each other in various ways,
you almost wonder that they never come into collision with each other.
The slightest movement in any direction seems sufficient to enable
them to overtake and secure their prey; and they less frequently than
any other species follow an insect upward to any great distance. Like
all other Swallows, they drink and bathe on wing.
</p>

<p>
Their migrations are performed by day, although perhaps continued
by night, and their movements are more desultory and rather
slower than those of other Swallows. It is rare to observe them in
great flocks at that time, their associations not being apparently formed
until they reach the countries in which they spend the winter months.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_587' href='#Page_587'>587</a></span>
Their flight, when they are thus travelling, is continued rather low
over the land or the water; and as in America they retire to a less
distance southward than our other Swallows, they are not unfrequently
seen to linger behind the rest. In South Carolina, indeed, I have seen
some in November.
</p>

<p>
In summer and autumn they roost in the holes excavated for their
nests; but in winter, at least in the Floridas, they always repose at
night among the tall grass of the salt marshes, making choice of situations
sheltered by the winds and not liable to be overflowed. At this
time they keep together in large bodies while searching for food. I
have several times accidentally crossed their roosting places, which I
at once recognised by the quantity of their dung attached to the blades,
and lying on the ground, and from which I infer that they rest clinging
to the plants.
</p>

<p>
At the first appearance of spring they leave their winter quarters
in pairs, or singly, or in very small flocks; but they follow each other
so closely in this manner as to form an almost continued line of march.
I had the pleasure of observing this to be the case with the Barn Swallow
also, whilst I was proceeding toward the Texas, when that species
was advancing in a contrary direction.
</p>

<p>
Although small, the Sand Swallow is a rather hardy bird: for I
observed that the transient cold weather that at times occurs in the
Florida at night, seldom forces them to remove farther south. On
one occasion, however, when the ice was about the thickness of a dollar,
many were found dead along the shores, as well as floating on the
water, whilst the rest appeared in great perturbation, wending their
way in a hurried manner toward the warmer parts of the country, and
taking advantage of every spot that afforded them more warmth, such as
the borders of woods, and high banks of streams. I am, however, of
opinion that the inclemency of the weather at times proves to be the
greatest evil these birds have to encounter, especially when in early
spring they are moving northward, and occasionally meet with a sudden
change from temperate to cold. Even in the places selected for
their summer residence, great numbers die in their holes, and many
have been found there in a state bordering on torpidity.
</p>

<p>
Their food, which consists of small insects, principally of the hymenopterous
kind, even during winter in the Floridas, is procured on
wing. They very seldom approach walls or the trunks of trees to seize
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_588' href='#Page_588'>588</a></span>
them, but frequently snatch them from the tops of grasses or other
plants on which they have alighted. They also seize small aquatic
insects; but, although, I suspect that they disgorge in pellets the
harder parts of these, I have no proof, obtained from actual observation,
that they do so.
</p>

<p>
The holes perforated by this species for the purpose of breeding
require considerable exertion and labour. They are usually bored at
the distance of two or three feet from the summit of the bank or surface
of the ground, to the depth of about three feet, but sometimes to
that of four or even five. They are near each other or remote, according
to the number of pairs of swallows that resort to the place, and
the extent of the bank. In one situation you may find not more than
a dozen pairs at work, while in another several hundreds of holes may
be seen scattered over some hundreds of yards. On the bluffs of the
Ohio and the Mississippi there are many very extensive breeding-places.
While engaged in digging a sand-bank on the shore of the
Ohio, at Henderson, for the purpose of erecting a steam-mill, I was
both amused and vexed by the pertinacity with which the little winged
labourers continued to bore holes day after day, whilst the pickaxes
and shovels demolished them in succession. The birds seemed to have
formed a strong attachment to the place, perhaps on account of the fine
texture of the soil, as I observed many who had begun holes a few
hundred yards off abandon them, and join those engaged in the newly
opened excavation. Whether the holes are frequently bored horizontally
or not I cannot say, but many which I examined differed in this
respect from those described by authors, for on introducing a gun-rod
or other straight stick, I found them to have an inclination of about
ten degrees upwards. The end of the hole is enlarged in the form of
an oven, for the reception of the nest, and the accommodation of the
parents and their brood.
</p>

<p>
When the birds have for a while examined the nature of the bank,
they begin their work by alighting against it, securing themselves by the
claws, and spreading their tails considerably so as, by being pressed
against the surface, to support the body. The bill is now employed in
picking the soil, until a space large enough to admit the body of the
bird is formed, when the feet and claws are also used in scratching out
the sand. I have thought that the slight ascent of the burrow contributed
considerably to enable the bird to perform the severe task of disposing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_589' href='#Page_589'>589</a></span>
of the loose materials, which are seen dropping out at irregular
intervals. Both sexes work alternately, in the same manner as Woodpeckers;
and few ornithological occupations have proved more pleasing
to me than that of watching several hundred pairs of these winged
artificers all busily and equally engaged, some in digging the burrows,
others in obtaining food, which they would now and then bring in their
bills for the use of their mates, or in procuring bits of dry grass or large
feathers of the duck or goose, for the construction of their nests.
</p>

<p>
So industrious are the little creatures that I have known a hole dug
to the depth of three feet four inches, and the nest finished in four
days, the first egg being deposited on the morning of the fifth. It
sometimes happens that soon after the excavation has been commenced,
some obstruction presents itself, defying the utmost exertions of the
birds; in which case they abandon the spot, and begin elsewhere in the
neighbourhood. If these obstructions occur and are pretty general,
the colony leaves the place; and it is very seldom that, after such an
occurrence, any swallows of this species are seen near it. I have sometimes
been surprised to see them bore in extremely loose sand. On
the sea coast, where soft banks are frequent, you might suppose that,
as the burrows are only a few inches apart, the sand might fall in so as
to obstruct the holes and suffocate their inmates; but I have not met
with an instance of such a calamitous occurrence. Along the banks of
small rivulets I have found these birds having nests within a foot or
two of the water, having been bored among the roots of some large trees,
where I thought they were exposed to mice, rats, or other small predaceous
animals. The nest is generally formed of some short bits of
dry grass, and lined with a considerable number of large feathers.
They lay from five to seven eggs for the first brood, fewer for the next.
They are of an ovate, somewhat pointed form, pure white, eight-twelfths
of an inch long, and six-twelfths in breadth
</p>

<p>
The young, as soon as they are able to move with ease, often crawl
to the entrance of the hole, to wait the return of their parents with
food. On such occasions they are often closely watched by the smaller
Hawks, as well as the common Crows, which seize and devour them, in
spite of the clamour of the old birds. These depredations upon the
young are in fact continued after they have left the nest, and while they
are perched on the dry twigs of the low trees in the neighbourhood,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_590' href='#Page_590'>590</a></span>
until they are perfectly able to maintain themselves on wing without
the assistance of their parents.
</p>

<p>
In Louisiana, or in any district where this species raises more than
one brood in the season, the males, I believe, take the principal charge
of the young that have left the nest, though both sexes alternately incubate,
all their moments being thus rendered full of care and anxiety
respecting both their offspring and the sitting bird. The young acquire
the full brown plumage of the adult by the first spring, when there is
no observable difference between them; but I am induced to think
that they keep apart from the old birds during the first winter, when I
have thought I could yet perceive an inferiority in their flight, as well
as in the loudness of their notes.
</p>

<p>
This species has no song, properly so called, but merely a twitter
of short lisping notes. In autumn it at times alights on trees preparatory
to its departure. On such occasions the individuals, often collected
in great numbers, take up the time chiefly in pluming themselves,
in which occupation they continue for hours.
</p>

<p>
I must conclude with assuring you that in my opinion, no difference
whatever exists between the Bank Swallow of America and that
of Europe. The birds from which I made the drawing for my plate
were procured on the banks of the Schuylkil River in 1824.

perfectly similar. There is, however, another species closely allied to

<h2>
ROUGH-WINGED SWALLOW.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Hirundo serripennis.</i></span>
</p>


<p>
On the afternoon of the 20th of October 1819, I was walking along
the shores of a forest-margined lake, a few miles from Bayou Sara, in pursuit
of some Ibises, when I observed a flock of small Swallows bearing
so great a resemblance to our common Sand Martin, that I at first paid
little attention to them. The Ibises proving too wild to be approached,
I relinquished the pursuit, and being fatigued by a long day’s exertion,
I leaned against a tree, and gazed on the Swallows, wishing
that I could travel with as much ease and rapidity as they, and thus
return to my family as readily as they could to their winter quarters.
How it happened I cannot now recollect, but I thought of shooting
some of them, perhaps to see how expert I might prove on other occasions.
Off went a shot, and down came one of the birds, which my dog
brought to me between his lips. Another, a third, a fourth, and at
last a fifth were procured. The ever-continuing desire of comparing
one bird with another led me to take them up. I thought them rather
large, and therefore placed them in my bag, and proceeded slowly toward
the plantation of <span class="smcap">William Perry</span>, Esq., with whom I had for a
time taken up my residence.
</p>

<p>
The bill and feet of the Swallows were pure black, and both, I thought,
were larger than in the Sand Martin; but differences like these I seldom
hold in much estimation, well knowing from long experience, that individuals
of any species may vary in these respects. I was more
startled when I saw not a vestige of the short feathers usually found
near the junction of the hind toe with the tarsus in the common species,
and equally so when I observed that the bird in my hand had a nearly
even tail, with broad rounded feathers, the outer destitute of the narrow
margin of white. At this time my observations went no farther.
</p>

<p>
Doubts have been expressed by learned ornithologists respecting
the identity of the Common Sand Martin of America and that of Europe.
Some of them in their treatises write <i>Hirundo riparia?</i> or <i>Cotyle
riparia?</i> which in my opinion is foolish, especially if no reason be given
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_594' href='#Page_594'>594</a></span>
for appending so crooked a character. About two years ago, my friend
the Rev. <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, sent me four Swallow’s eggs accompanied
with a letter, in which was the following notice:—“Two pairs of Swallows
resembling the Sand Martin, have built their nests for two years
in succession in the walls of an unfinished brick house at Charleston, in
the holes where the scaffoldings had been placed. It is believed here
that there are two species of these birds.” The eggs which my friend
sent me differ greatly from those of our Common Sand Martin, being
so much longer, larger, and more pointed, that I might have felt inclined
to suppose them to belong to the European Swift, <i>Cypselus murarius</i>.
But of the birds which had laid them no particular account
was given. Time has passed; and during the while I have been anxious
to meet again with such Swallows as I had shot near Bayou Sara,
as well as to determine whether our Common Sand Martin be the same
as that of Europe. And now, Reader, I am at last able to say, that
the Sand Martin or Bank Swallow, <i>Hirundo riparia</i>, is common to Europe
and America; and further, that a species, confounded with it in
the latter country, is perfectly distinct.
</p>

<p>
I perhaps should never have discovered the differences existing between
these species had I not been spurred by the remarks of <span class="smcap">Vieillot</span>,
who, in expressing his doubts as to their identity, and perhaps holding
in his hand the bird here spoken of, says that the tarsus is much larger
than in the European Sand Martin. I have been surprised that these
doubts did not awaken in others a desire to inquire into the subject.
Had this been done, however, I should probably have lost an opportunity
of adding another new species to those to whose nomination I can
lay claim, not to speak of such as, although well known to me previous
to their having been published by others, I have lost the right of naming
because I had imparted my knowledge of them to those who were
more anxious of obtaining this sort of celebrity. I have now in my possession
one pair of these Swallows procured by myself in South Carolina
during my last visit to that State. Of their peculiar habits I can
say nothing; but, owing to their being less frequent than the Sand Martin,
I am inclined to believe that their most habitual residence may
prove to be far to the westward, perhaps in the valleys of the Columbia
River.
</p>

<p>
I regret that I have not figured this species, though it would have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_595' href='#Page_595'>595</a></span>
proved exceedingly difficult to exhibit in an engraving the peculiar
character presented by the outer quill, unless it were much magnified.
</p>

<p>
The specific characters of these two Swallows, so nearly allied, are
as follows:—

<p>
In its general appearance, including proportions as well as colour,
the Rough-winged Swallow is extremely similar to the Bank Swallow.
It differs however in having the bill considerably longer, more attenuated
toward the end, with the point of the upper mandible more decurved.
The tail, Fig. 2, is shorter and but slightly emarginate, the
lateral exceeding the middle feathers by only two-twelfths of an inch,
whereas in the other species they exceed them by five-twelfths or even
six; feathers are also broader and more rounded at the end. The wings
are longer, and extend half an inch beyond the tail. The tarsi and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_596' href='#Page_596'>596</a></span>
toes are somewhat longer and more slender, and there are no feathers
on the hind part of the tarsus as in the common species; the claws
are much more slender.
</p>

<p>
The bill is black, the tarsi, toes, and claws dusky. The upper
parts are of the same greyish-brown, or mouse-colour, as those of the
Bank Swallow. The lower are of a very light greyish-brown, gradually
paler on the hind parts, the abdomen and lower tail-coverts being
white.

<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>


<p>
Of this, the most beautiful Swallow hitherto discovered within the
limits of the United States, the following account has been transmitted
to me by my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>. “We first met with this elegant
species within the table-land of the Rocky Mountains, and they were
particularly abundant around our encampment on Harris Fork, a branch
of the Colorado of the west. They are nearly always associated with
the Cliff Swallow, here likewise particularly numerous. Their flight
and habits are also similar, but their twitter is different, and not much
unlike the note of our Barn Swallow. In the Rocky Mountains, near
our camp, we observed them to go in and out of deserted nests of the
Cliff Swallow, which they appeared to occupy in place of building nests
of their own. We saw this species afterwards flying familiarly about
in the vicinity of a farm-house (M. <span class="smcap">Le Boute</span>’s) on an elevated small
isolated prairie on the banks of the Wahlamet, and as there are no
cliffs in the vicinity, they probably here breed in trees, as I observed
the White-bellied Martin do. This beautiful species in all probability
extends its limits from hence to the table-land of Mexico, where Mr
<span class="smcap">Bulloch</span>, it seems, found it.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>, who afterwards had better opportunities of observing
the habits of this bird, thus speaks of it:—“<i>Aguila chin chin</i> of the
Chinook Indians, inhabits the neighbourhood of the Colorado of the
west, and breeds along its margins on bluffs of clay, where it attaches
a nest formed of mud and grasses resembling in some measure that of
the Cliff Swallow, but wanting the pendulous neck in that of the latter
species. The eggs are four, of a dark clay colour, with a few spots of
reddish-brown at the larger end. This species is also found abundant
on the lower waters of the Columbia. River, where <i>it breeds in hollow
trees</i>.”
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Townsend</span> also informs me that in the neighbourhood of the
Columbia River, the Cliff Swallow attaches its nest to the trunks of
trees, making it of the same form and materials as elsewhere. From
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_598' href='#Page_598'>598</a></span>
the above facts, and many equally curious, which I have mentioned, respecting
the variations exhibited by birds in the manner of forming their
nests, as well as in their size, materials, and situation, it will be seen
that differences of this kind are not of so much importance as has
hitherto been supposed, in establishing distinctions between species
supposed by some to be different, and by others identical. To give
you some definite idea of what I would here impress upon your mind,
I need only say that I have seen nests of the Barn or Chimney Swallow
placed within buildings, under cattle-sheds, against the sides of
wells, and in chimneys; that while some were not more than three
inches deep, others measured nearly nine; while in some there was
scarcely any grass, in others it formed nearly half of their bulk. I have
also observed some nests of the Cliff Swallow in which the eggs had
been deposited before the pendent neck was added, and which remained
so until the birds had reared their brood, amidst other nests furnished
with a neck, which was much longer in some than in others.
From this I have inferred that nests are formed more or less completely,
in many instances, in accordance with the necessity under which
the bird may be of depositing its eggs.

<h2>
GREAT AMERICAN EGRET.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea Egretta</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXVI. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
In the third volume of this work, I have already intimated that the
truly elegant Heron which now comes to be described, is a constant
resident in the Floridas, that it migrates eastward sometimes as far as
the State of Massachusetts, and up the Mississippi to the city of
Natchez, and, lastly, that it is never seen far inland, by which I mean
that its rambles into the interior seldom extend to more than fifty miles
from the sea-shore, unless along the course of our great rivers. I have
now to add that on my way to the Texas, in the spring of 1837, I found
these birds in several places along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico,
and on several of the islands scattered around that named Galveston,
where, as well as in the Floridas, I was told that they spend the winter.
</p>

<p>
The Great American Egret breeds along the shores of the Gulf of
Mexico, and our Atlantic States, from Galveston Island in the Texas to
the borders of the State of New York, beyond which, although stragglers
have been seen, none, in so far as I can ascertain, have been known to
breed. In all low districts that are marshy and covered with large
trees, on the margins of ponds or lakes, the sides of bayous, or
gloomy swamps covered with water, are the places to which it generally
resorts during the period of reproduction; although I have in a
few instances met with their nests on low trees, and on sandy islands
at a short distance from the main land. As early as December I have observed
vast numbers congregated, as if for the purpose of making choice
of partners, when the addresses of the males were paid in a very curious
and to me interesting manner. Near the plantation of <span class="smcap">John Bulow</span>,
Esq. in East Florida, I had the pleasure of witnessing this sort of tournament
or dress-ball from a place of concealment not more than a hundred
yards distant. The males, in strutting round the females, swelled
their throats, as Cormorants do at times, emitted gurgling sounds,
and raising their long plumes almost erect, paced majestically before
the fair ones of their choice. Although these snowy beaux were a good
deal irritated by jealousy, and conflicts now and then took place, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_601' href='#Page_601'>601</a></span>
whole time I remained, much less fighting was exhibited than I had
expected from what I had already seen in the case of the Great Blue
Heron, <i>Ardea Herodias</i>. These meetings took place about ten o’clock
in the morning, or after they had all enjoyed a good breakfast, and
continued until nearly three in the afternoon, when, separating into
flocks of eight or ten individuals, they flew off to search for food.
These manœuvres were continued nearly a week, and I could with ease,
from a considerable distance mark the spot, which was a clear sand-bar,
by the descent of the separate small flocks previous to their alighting
there.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is in strength intermediate between
that of <i>Ardea Herodias</i> and <i>A. rufescens</i>, and is well sustained. On
foot its movements are as graceful as those of the Louisiana Heron,
its steps measured, its long neck gracefully retracted and curved, and
its silky train reminded one of the flowing robes of the noble ladies of
Europe. The train of this Egret, like that of other species, makes
its appearance a few weeks previous to the love season, continues to
grow and increase in beauty, until incubation has commenced, after
which period it deteriorates, and at length disappears about the time
when the young birds leave the nest, when, were it not for the difference
in size, it would be difficult to distinguish them from their parents.
Should you however closely examine the upper plumage of an
old bird of either sex, for both possess the train, you will discover that
its feathers still exist, although shortened and deprived of most of their
filaments. Similar feathers are seen in all other Herons that have a
largely developed train in the breeding season. Even the few plumes
hanging from the hind part of the <i>Ardea Herodias</i>, <i>A. Nycticorax</i>, and
<i>A. violacea</i>, are subject to the same rule; and it is curious to see these
ornaments becoming more or less apparent, according to the latitude
in which these birds breed, their growth being completed in the southern
part of Florida two months sooner than in our Middle Districts.
</p>

<p>
The American Egrets leave the Floridas almost simultaneously about
the 1st of March, and soon afterwards reach Georgia and South Carolina,
but rarely the State of New Jersey, before the middle of May.
In these parts the young are able to fly by the 1st of August. On the
Mule Keys off the coast of Florida, I have found the young well grown
by the 8th of May; but in South Carolina they are rarely hatched until
toward the end of that month or the beginning of June. In these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_602' href='#Page_602'>602</a></span>
more southern parts two broods are often raised in a season, but in the
Jerseys there is, I believe, never more than one. While travelling,
early in spring, between Savannah in Georgia and Charleston in South
Carolina, I saw many of these Egrets on the large rice plantations,
and felt some surprise at finding them much wilder at that period of
their migrations than after they have settled in some locality for the
purpose of breeding. I have supposed this to be caused by the change
of their <i>thoughts</i> on such occasions, and am of opinion that birds of all
kinds become more careless of themselves. As the strength of their
attachment toward their mates or progeny increases through the process
of time, as is the case with the better part of our own species,
lovers and parents performing acts of heroism, which individuals having
no such attachment to each other would never dare to contemplate.
In these birds the impulse of affection is so great, that when they
have young they allow themselves to be approached, so as often to fall
victims to the rapacity of man, who, boasting of reason and benevolence,
ought at such a time to respect their devotion.
</p>

<p>
The American Egrets are much attached to their roosting places, to
which they remove from their feeding grounds regularly about an hour
before the last glimpse of day; and I cannot help expressing my disbelief
in the vulgar notion of birds of this family usually feeding by
night, as I have never observed them so doing even in countries where
they were most abundant. Before sunset the Egrets and other Herons
(excepting perhaps the Bitterns and Night Herons) leave their feeding
grounds in small flocks, often composed of only a single family, and
proceed on wing in the most direct course, at a moderate height, to
some secure retreat more or less distant, according to the danger they
may have to guard against. Flock after flock may be seen repairing from
all quarters to these places of repose, which one may readily discover
by observing their course.
</p>

<p>
Approach and watch them. Some hundreds have reached the
well-known rendezvous. After a few gratulations you see them lower
their bodies on the stems of the trees or bushes on which they have
alighted, fold their necks, place their heads beneath the scapular feathers,
and adjust themselves for repose. Daylight returns, and they are
all in motion. The arrangement of their attire is not more neglected by
them than by the most fashionable fops, but they spend less time at
the toilet. Their rough notes are uttered more loudly than in the evening,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_603' href='#Page_603'>603</a></span>
and after a very short lapse of time they spread their snowy pinions,
and move in different directions, to search for fiddlers, fish, insects
of all sorts, small quadrupeds or birds, snails, and reptiles, all of
which form the food of this species.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Great White Egret, whether placed in a cypress one
hundred and thirty feet high, or on a mangrove not six feet above the
water, whether in one of those dismal swamps swarming with loathsome
reptiles, or by the margin of the clear blue waters that bathe the
Keys of Florida, is large, flat, and composed of sticks, often so loosely
put together as to make you wonder how it can hold, besides itself, the
three young ones which this species and all the larger Herons have at
a brood. In a few instances only have I found it compactly built, it
being the first nest formed by its owners. It almost always overhangs
the water, and is resorted to and repaired year after year by the same
pair. The eggs, which are never more than three, measure two inches
and a quarter in length, an inch and five-eighths in breadth, and when
newly laid are smooth, and of a pale blue colour, but afterwards become
roughish and faded. When the nest is placed on a tall tree, the
young remain in it, or on its borders, until they are able to fly; but
when on a low tree or bush, they leave it much sooner, being capable
of moving along the branches without fear of being injured by falling,
and knowing that should they slip into the water they can easily extricate
themselves by striking with their legs until they reach either the
shore or the nearest bush, by clinging to the stem, of which they soon
ascend to the top.
</p>

<p>
This Egret is shy and vigilant at all times, seldom allowing a
person to come near unless during the breeding season. If in a rice-field
of some extent, and at some distance from its margins, where
cover can be obtained, you need not attempt to approach it; but if
you are intent on procuring it, make for some tree, and desire your
friend to start the bird. If you are well concealed, you may almost
depend on obtaining one in a few minutes, for the Egrets will perhaps
alight within twenty yards or less of you. Once, when I was very desirous
of making a new drawing of this bird, my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>
followed this method, and between us we carried home several
superb specimens.
</p>

<p>
The long plumes of this bird being in request for ornamental purposes,
they are shot in great numbers while sitting on their eggs, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_604' href='#Page_604'>604</a></span>
soon after the appearance of the young. I know a person who, on offering
a double-barrelled gun to a gentlemen near Charleston, for one
hundred White Herons fresh killed, received that number and more
the next day.
</p>

<p>
The Great Egret breeds in company with the Anhinga, the Great
Blue Heron, and other birds of this family. The Turkey Buzzards and
the Crows commit dreadful havoc among its young, as well as those of
the other species. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> gives me the following
account of his visit to one of its breeding places, at the “Round O,” a
plantation about forty miles from Charleston: “Our company was composed
of <span class="smcap">Benjamin Logan</span>, <span class="smcap">S. Lee</span>, and Dr <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. We were desirous
of obtaining some of the Herons as specimens for stuffing, and the
ladies were anxious to procure many of their primary feathers for the
purpose of making fans. The trees were high, from a hundred to a
hundred and thirty feet, and our shot was not of the right size; but we
commenced firing at the birds, and soon discovered that we had a prospect
of success. Each man took his tree, and loaded and fired as fast
as he could. Many of the birds lodged on the highest branches of the
cypresses, others fell into the nest, and, in most cases, when shot from
a limb, where they had been sitting, they clung to it for some time
before they would let go. One thing surprised me: it was the length
of time it took for a bird to fall from the place where it was shot, and
it fell with a loud noise into the water. Many wounded birds fell some
distance off, and we could not conveniently follow them on account of the
heavy wading through the place. We brought home with us forty-six
of the large White Herons, and three of the great Blues. Many more
might have been killed, but we became tired of shooting them.”

The roof of the mouth is slightly concave, with a median and two
lateral longitudinal ridges, the palate convex, the posterior aperture of
the nares linear, without an anterior slit. The mouth is rather narrow,
measuring only 8 twelfths across, but is dilatable to <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch, the branches
of the lower mandible being very elastic. The aperture of the ear
is very small, being 2 twelfths in diameter, and roundish. The œsophagus
is 2 feet 2 inches long, 1 inch and 4 twelfths in diameter, extremely
thin, the longitudinal fibres
within the transverse, the inner
coat raised into numerous longitudinal
ridges. The œsophagus continues
of uniform diameter, and
passes as it were directly into the
stomach, there being no enlargement
at its termination indicative
of the proventriculus, which however
exists, but in a modified form,
there being at the termination of
the gullet eight longitudinal series
of large mucous crypts, about half
an inch long, and immediately afterwards
a continuous belt, <span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch

having externally beneath the
cellular coat a layer of slender muscular
fibres, convex towards two roundish tendons, and internally a
soft, thin, smooth lining, perforated by innumerable minute apertures
of glandules. The intestine is very long and extremely slender, measuring
6 feet 7 inches in length, its average diameter 2 twelfths. The

GLOSSY IBIS.
</h2>

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ibis Falcinellus</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="subtitle smcap">PLATE CCCLXXXVII. Male.</span>
</p>


<p>
The first intimation of the existence of this beautiful species of
Ibis within the limits of the United States is due to Mr <span class="smcap">George Ord</span>
of Philadelphia, the friend and companion of the celebrated <span class="smcap">Alexander
Wilson</span>. It was described by him in the first volume of the Journal of
the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He states that “on
the seventh of May of the present year (1817), Mr <span class="smcap">Thomas Say</span> received
from Mr <span class="smcap">Oram</span>, of Great Egg Harbour, a fine specimen of <i>Tantalus</i>,
which had been shot there. It is the first instance which has come to
my knowledge of this species having been found in the United States.
I was informed that a recent specimen of this bird was, likewise in the
month of May, presented to the Baltimore Museum, and that two individuals
were killed in the district of Columbia.” In the sequel Mr
<span class="smcap">Ord</span> compares it with Dr <span class="smcap">Latham</span>’s account of the <i>Tantalus Mexicanus</i>
of that author, and conjectures that it is the same.
</p>

<p>
It is not a little curious to see the changes of opinion that have
taken place within these few years among naturalists who have thought
of comparing American and European specimens of the birds which
have been alleged to be the same in both continents. The Prince of
<span class="smcap">Musignano</span>, for example, who has given a figure of the very individual
mentioned by Mr <span class="smcap">Ord</span>, thought at the time when he published the
fourth volume of his continuation of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s American Ornithology,
that our Glossy Ibis was the one described by the older European writers
under the name of <i>Ibis Falcinellus</i>. Now, however, having altered his
notions so far as to seem desirous of proving that the same species
of bird cannot exist on both the continents, he has latterly produced it
anew under the name of <i>Ibis Ordi</i>. This new name I cannot with any
degree of propriety adopt. I consider it no compliment to the discoverer
of a bird to reject the name which he has given it, even for the
purpose of calling it after himself.
</p>

<p>
The Glossy Ibis is of exceedingly rare occurrence in the United
States, where it appears only at long and irregular intervals, like a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_609' href='#Page_609'>609</a></span>
wanderer who has lost his way. It exists in Mexico, however, in vast
numbers. In the spring of 1837, I saw flocks of it in the Texas; but
even there it is merely a summer resident, associating with the White
Ibis, along the grassy margins of the rivers and bayous, and apparently
going to and returning from its roosting places in the interior of the
country. Its flight resembles that of its companion, the White Ibis,
and it is probable that it feeds on the same kinds of crustaceous animals,
and breeds on low bushes in the same great associations as
that species, but we unfortunately had no opportunity of verifying this
conjecture. Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, in his Ornithology of the United States and
Canada, says that “a specimen has occasionally been exposed for sale
in the market of Boston.”
</p>

<p>
I have given the figure of a male bird in superb plumage, procured

Adult Male. Plate CCCLXXXVII.
</p>

<p>
Bill very long, slender, higher than broad, compressed, tapering,
acute, obtuse. Upper mandible with the dorsal line arched in its
whole length, the ridge convex, broader towards the end, the sides at
the base nearly erect, towards the end very convex and narrow, the
ridge separated in its whole length from the sides by a deep narrow
groove, the edges inflected and sharp. Nostrils basal, dorsal, linear,
direct. Lower mandible more slender than the upper, its angle very
narrow, and protracted in the form of a groove to the tip, the sides
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_610' href='#Page_610'>610</a></span>
convex, the edges sharp, but strong and closely approximated, bearing
only a very narrow groove between them.
</p>

<p>
Head small, compressed, oblong; neck long and slender; body
slender, deeper than broad; wings rather large. Feet very long, slender;
tibia long, bare about half its length, and covered all round with
hexagonal scales; tarsi long, slender, anteriorly covered with numerous
broad scutella, laterally with angular scales, beneath flattened,
with thick soft margins; the anterior connected at the base by membranes,
of which the outer is large; claws rather small, slightly arched,
compressed, tapering, pointed, that of the middle toe with a sharp thin
edge.
</p>

<p>
There is a bare space margining the forehead, occupying the part
before the eye, and extending a little beyond it. Feathers of the head
and neck slender lanceolate; those of the former glossy and compact,
of the latter blended, as are those of the breast and abdomen, which
are ovate. The upper parts highly glossed, with silky lustre, the feathers
generally ovate and rounded. Wings long, ample, the first primary a
quarter of an inch shorter than the second, which is two-twelfths longer
than the third, the rest moderately graduated; the first sinuate on the
inner web near the end, the second less deeply so; some of the inner
secondaries elongated, but rounded, and when the wing is closed an
inch and ten-twelfths shorter than the longest primary. Tail short,
very slightly emarginate, of twelve rounded feathers.
</p>

<p>
Bill black; bare part of the head greyish-blue; iris hazel; feet
greyish-black, claws brown. The upper part and sides of the head are
dark glossy, with purplish reflections. The neck, a portion of the back
anteriorly, the breast, abdomen, and legs, are of a deep rich brownish-red,
or dark chestnut; part of the breast shaded with green, the sides
dusky tinged with green, as are the lower wing-coverts, and lower tail-coverts.
Excepting the anterior edge of the wing, and the anterior
scapulars, which are deep glossy brownish-red, the upper parts are
splendent dark green, glossed with purple; the primaries black, shaded
with green; the tail glossy with purple reflections.

</p>

<p class="p2">
The Female is similar to the male, but somewhat less.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The young in its second plumage, has the bill dusky, tinged with
yellow, the bare part of the head dusky; the feet blackish-brown, the
head, neck and lower parts are greyish-brown, the head and greater
part of the neck marked with small longitudinal streaks of white, of
which there are two on each feather. All the upper parts are blackish-green,
glossy in a less degree than those of the adult.
</p>

<p class="p2">
On comparing adult American specimens with others obtained on
the old continent, I can perceive no difference between them. A
young Mexican bird, and one from India, are also precisely similar.
I cannot therefore entertain a doubt as to the identity of our bird with
the <i>Tantalus Falcinellus</i> of <span class="smcap">Latham</span> and other European writers, which
has been shewn by <span class="smcap">Savigny</span> to be the Black Ibis of the ancients.
